  <h2>Sustainable School Travel Strategy</h2>
  <p>
    Over the last 20 years, the number of children being driven to school in
    England has doubled. National data suggests that one in five cars on the
    road at 8.50 am is engaged in the school run. Children are subject to up to
    3.9 times more pollution in a car that is standing in traffic than when
    walking or cycling to school. Reducing cars around schools makes them safer
    places, and walking and cycling are better for health and the environment.
    It has been noted by teachers that children engaging in active travel arrive
    at school more alert and ready to learn.
  </p>
  <p>
    The County Council has a strong commitment to supporting and promoting
    sustainable school travel. We collect data annually about how pupils get to
    school, and our report on the Sustainable School Travel Strategy sets out in
    detail what we have achieved so far and what we intend to do in the future.
    Different parts of the County Council are working together to address the
    actions identified in the strategy, and we are proud that we have been able
    to reduce the number of cars on the daily school run by an average of 1% in
    each of the last three years, which is equivalent to taking approximately
    175 cars off the road annually, despite an increase in pupil numbers.
  </p>
  <p>
    All schools have a School Travel Plan, which sets out how the school and the
    Council can collaborate to help reduce travel to school by car and encourage
    the use of public transport. Contact your school to find out what they are
    doing as part of their School Travel Plan to help you get your child to
    school in a sustainable, safe way.

  <h3>Flu: the facts</h3>

  <p>
    <b>A.</b> Flu (influenza) is an acute viral respiratory infection. It
    spreads easily from person to person: at home, at school, at work, at the
    supermarket or on the train.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>B.</b> It gets passed on when someone who already has flu coughs or
    sneezes and is transmitted through the air by droplets, or it can be spread
    by hands infected by the virus.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>C.</b> Symptoms can include fever, chills, headache, muscle pain, extreme
    fatigue, a dry cough, sore throat and stuffy nose. Most people will recover
    within a week but flu can cause severe illness or even death in people at
    high risk. It is estimated that 18,500-24,800 deaths in England and Wales
    are attributable to influenza infections annually.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>D.</b> Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent infection.
    Although anyone can catch flu, certain people are at greater risk from the
    implications of flu, as their bodies may not be able to fight the virus. If
    you are over 65 years old, or suffer from asthma, diabetes, or certain other
    conditions, you are considered at greater risk from flu and the implications
    can be serious. If you fall into one of these ‘at- risk’ groups, are
    pregnant or a carer, you are eligible for a free flu vaccination.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>E.</b> If you are not eligible for a free flu vaccination, you can still
    protect yourself and those around you from flu by getting a flu vaccination
    at a local pharmacy.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>F.</b> About seven to ten days after vaccination, your body makes
    antibodies that help to protect you against any similar viruses that may
    infect you. This protection lasts about a year.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>G.</b> A flu vaccination contains inactivated, killed virus strains so it
    can’t give you the flu. However, a flu vaccination can take up to two weeks
    to begin working, so it is possible to catch flu in this period.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>H.</b> A flu vaccination is designed to protect you against the most
    common and potent strains of flu circulating so there is a small chance you
    could catch a strain of flu not contained in the flu vaccine.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>I.</b> The influenza virus is constantly changing and vaccines are
    developed to predicted strains each year so it is important to get
    vaccinated against the latest strains.
  </p>
  <p>Speak to your GP or nurse today to book your flu vaccination.</p>

  <h3>Reading Passage 2</h3>
  <p>Read the text below and answer Questions 15-27</p>

  <h2>Tips for giving an effective business presentation</h2>

  <p><b>Preparation</b></p>
  <p>
    Get someone else to evaluate your performance and highlight your best
    skills. For example, go through your presentation in front of a colleague or
    relative. Think about who your audience is and what you want them to get out
    of the presentation. Think about content and style.
  </p>
  <p>
    Go into the presentation room and try out any moves you may have to make,
    for example, getting up from your chair and moving to the podium. Errors in
    the first 20 seconds can be very disorientating.
  </p>
  <p>
    Familiarise yourself with the electronic equipment before the presentation
    and also have a backup plan in mind, should there be an unexpected problem
    like a power cut.
  </p>
  <p><b>Dealing with presentation nervousness</b></p>
  <p>
    A certain amount of nervousness is vital for a good presentation. The added
    adrenaline will keep your faculties sharp and give your presentation skills
    extra force. This can, however, result in tension in the upper chest.
    Concentrate on your breathing. Slow it right down and this will relax you.
    Strangely, having something to pick up and put down tends to help you do
    this.
  </p>
  <p>
    It may seem an odd idea, but we seem to feel calmer when we engage in what’s
    referred to as a displacement activity, like clicking a pen or fiddling with
    jewelery. A limited amount of this will not be too obvious and can make you
    feel more secure at the start.
  </p>
  <p><b>Interacting with your audience</b></p>
  <p>
    Think of your presentation as a conversation with your audience. They may
    not actually say anything, but make them feel consulted, questioned,
    challenged, then they will stay awake and attentive.
  </p>
  <p>
    Engage with your present audience, not the one you have prepared for. Keep
    looking for reactions to your ideas and respond to them. If your audience
    doesn’t appear to be following you, find another way to get your ideas
    across. If you don’t interact, you might as well send a video recording of
    your presentation instead!
  </p>
  <p><b>Structuring effective presentations</b></p>
  <p>
    Effective presentations are full of examples. These help your listeners to
    see more clearly what you mean. It’s quicker and more colourful. Stick to
    the point using three or four main ideas. For any subsidiary information
    that you cannot present in 20 minutes, try another medium, such as handouts.
  </p>
  <p>
    End as if your presentation has gone well. Do this even if you feel you’ve
    presented badly.
  </p>
  <p>
    And anyway, a good finish will get you some applause – and you deserve it!

  <h2>How to get a job in journalism</h2>
  <p>
    You can get a good qualification in journalism, but what employers actually
    want is practical, rather than theoretical, knowledge. There’s no substitute
    for creating real stories that have to be handed in by strict deadlines. So
    write for your school magazine, then maybe try your hand at editing. Once
    you’ve done that for a while, start requesting internships in newspapers in
    the area. These are generally short-term and unpaid, but they’re definitely
    worthwhile, since, instead of providing you with money, they’ll teach you
    the skills that every twenty-first century journalist has to have, like
    laying out articles, creating web pages, taking good digital pictures and so
    on.
  </p>
  <p>
    Most reporters keep a copy of every story they’ve had published, from
    secondary school onwards. They’re called cuttings, and you need them to get
    a job — indeed a few impressive ones can be the deciding factor in whether
    you’re appointed or not. So start creating a portfolio now that will show
    off your developing talent.
  </p>
  <p>
    It seems obvious that research is an important part of an effective job
    hunt, but it’s surprising how many would-be journalists do little or none.
    If you’re thorough, it can help you decide whether the job you’re thinking
    about applying for is right for you. And nothing impresses an editor more
    than an applicant who knows a lot about the paper.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are two more elements to an application – your covering letter and
    curriculum vitae. However, your CV is the thing that will attract an
    editor’s attention first, so get it right. The key words are brevity (no
    more than one page), accuracy (absolutely no spelling or typing errors) and
    clarity (it should be easy to follow).
  </p>
  <p>
    In journalism, good writing skills are essential, so it’s critical that the
    style of your letter is appropriate. Moreover, make sure it conveys your
    love of journalism and your eagerness to do the work.

  <h3>Reading Passage 3</h3>
  <p>Read the text below and answer Questions 28-40</p>

  <h3>What is it like to run a large supermarket?</h3>
  <h3>Jill Insley finds out</h3>
  <p>
    <b>A</b><br />
    You can’t beat really good service. I’ve been shopping in the Thamesmead
    branch of supermarket chain Morrisons, in south-east London, and I’ve
    experienced at first hand, the store’s latest maxim for improving the
    shopping experience – help, offer, thank. This involves identifying
    customers who might need help, greeting them, asking what they need,
    providing it, thanking them and leaving them in peace. If they don’t look
    like they want help, they’ll be left alone. But if they’re standing looking
    lost and perplexed, a member of staff will approach them. Staff are expected
    to be friendly to everyone. My checkout assistant has certainly said
    something to amuse the woman in front of me, she’s smiling as she leaves.
    Adrian Perriss, manager of the branch, has discussed the approach with each
    of his 387 staff. He says it’s about recognising that someone needs help,
    not being a nuisance to them. When he’s in another store, he’s irritated by
    someone saying, ‘Can I help you?’ when he’s only just walked in to have a
    quick look at the products.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>B</b><br />
    How anyone can be friendly and enthusiastic when they start work at dawn
    beats me. The store opens at 7 am, Monday to Saturday, meaning that some
    staff, including Perriss, have to be here at 6 am to make sure it’s clean,
    safe and stocked up for the morning rush. Sometimes he walks in at 6 am and
    thinks they’re never going to be ready on time, but they always are. There’s
    so much going on overnight – 20 people working on unloading three enormous
    trailers full of groceries.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>C</b><br />
    Perriss has worked in supermarkets since 1982, when he became a trolley boy
    on a weekly salary of £76. ‘It was less money than my previous job, but I
    loved it. It was different and diverse. I was doing trolleys, portering,
    bread, cakes, dairy and general maintenance.’ After a period in the produce
    department looking after the fruit and vegetables, he was made produce
    manager, then assistant store manager before reaching the top job in 1998.
    This involved intensive training and assessment through the company’s future
    store manager programme, learning how to analyse and prioritise sales,
    wastage, recruitment and many other issues. Perriss’ first stop as store
    manager was at a store which was closed soon afterwards, though he was not
    to blame.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>D</b><br />
    Despite the disappointing start, his career went from strength to strength
    and he was put in charge of launching new stores and heading up a ‘concept’
    store, where the then new ideas of preparing and cooking pizzas in store,
    having a proper florist and fruit and vegetable ‘markets’ were trialled. All
    Morrisons’ managers from the whole country spent three days there to see the
    new concept. That was hard work,’ he says, ‘long days, seven days a week,
    for about a year.’
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>E</b><br />
    Although he oversees a store with a large turnover, there is a strongly
    practical aspect to Perriss’s job. As we walk around, he chats to all the
    staff while checking the layout of their counters and the quality of the
    produce. He examines the baking potato shelf and rejects three, one that has
    split virtually in half and two that are beginning to go green. He then
    pulls out a lemon that looks fine to me. When I ask why, he picks up a
    second lemon and says: ‘Close your eyes and just feel and tell me which you
    would keep.’ I do and realise that while one is firm and hard, the other is
    going a bit squashy.

    Despite eagle-eyed Perriss pulling out fruit and vegetable that most of us
    would buy without a second thought, the wastage each week is tiny: produce
    worth £4,200 is marked down for a quick sale, and only £400-worth is
    scrapped. This, he explains, is down to Morrisons’ method of ordering, still
    done manually rather than by computer. Department heads know exactly how
    much they’ve sold that day and how much they’re likely to sell the next,
    based on sales records and allowing for influences such as the weather.

    Perriss is in charge of 1,000 man-hours a week across the store. To help
    him, he has a key team of four, who each have direct responsibility for
    different departments. He is keen to hear what staff think. He recently held
    a ‘talent’ day, inviting employees interested in moving to a new job within
    the store to come and talk to him about why they thought they should be
    promoted, and discuss how to go about it. ‘We had twenty- three people come
    through the door, people wanting to talk about progression,’ he says. ‘What
    do they need to do to become a supervisor? Twenty-three people will be
    better members of staff as a result of that talk.’
  </p>

    <b>H</b><br />
    His favourite department is fish, which has a four-meter-long run by Debbie
    and Angela, who are busy having a discussion about how to cook a particular
    fish with a customer. But it is one of just 20 or so departments around the
    store and Perriss admits the pressure of making sure he knows what’s
    happening on them all can be intense. ‘You have to do so much and there
    could be something wrong with every single one, every day,’ he says. ‘You’ve
    got to minimise those things and shrink them into perspective. You’ve got to
    love the job.’ This is what Perriss certainly does.
