  <h3>Mission to Mars</h3>

  <p>
    <b>2011 Mars One Founded</b><br />
    In 2011 Bas Lansdorp and Arno Wielders lay the foundation of the Mars One
    mission plan. Discussion meetings are held with potential suppliers of
    aerospace components in the USA, Canada, Italy and United Kingdom. Mission
    architecture, budgets and timelines are solidified from the feedback of
    supplier engineers and business developers. A baseline design for a mission
    of permanent human settlement on Mars achievable with existing technology is
    the result.
    <br /><br />

    <b>2013 Start Crew Selection</b><br />
    In April 2013, the Astronaut Selection Program is launched at press
    conferences in New York and Shanghai. Round One is an online application
    open to all nationalities. The selection program proceeds with three
    additional rounds over the course of two years. At the end of it around six
    teams of four individuals are selected for training. A new batch of the
    Astronaut Selection Program begins every year to replenish the training pool
    regularly. An analogue of the Mars habitat is constructed on Earth for
    technology testing and training purposes.
    <br /><br /><b>2015 Start of Crew Training</b><br />
    Selected candidates from the first batch of applicants enter full-time
    training groups. This training continues until the launch in 2024. The
    group's ability to deal with prolonged periods of time in a remote location
    is the most important part of their training. They learn to repair
    components of the habitat and rover, learn to grow their own food, and train
    in medical procedures. The first outpost simulation, a Mars-like terrain
    that is relatively easy to reach is chosen. A second training outpost is
    located at a more remote environment like the Arctic desert.

    <br /><br /><b>2018 Demo and Comsat Mission</b><br />
    A Demonstration Mission is launched to Mars in May 2018; it provides proof
    of concept for some of the technologies that are important for a human
    mission. A communication satellite is also launched that is placed into a
    Mars stationary orbit. It enables 24/7 communication between the two
    planets. It can relay images, videos and other data from the Mars surface.
    <br /><br /><b>2020 Rover Mission Launched</b><br />
    One intelligent rover and one trailer are launched. The rover can use the
    trailer to transport the landers to the outpost location. On Mars, the rover
    drives around the chosen region to find the best location for the
    settlement. An ideal location for the settlement is far enough north for the
    soil to contain enough water, equatorial enough for maximum solar power and
    flat enough to facilitate construction of the settlement. When the
    settlement location is determined, the rover prepares the surface for
    arrival of the cargo missions. It also clears large areas where solar panels
    will lie. A second communications satellite is launched into orbit around
    the Sun.
    <br /><br /><b>2022 Cargo Missions Launched</b><br />
    Six cargo missions are launched and two living units, two life support
    systems, and two supply units are sent to Mars in July 2022. In February
    2023 all units land on Mars using a rover signal as a beacon.
    <br /><br /><b>2023 Outpost Operational</b><br />
    The six cargo units land on Mars, up to 10 km away from the outpost. The
    rover picks up the first life support unit using the trailer, takes it to
    the right place, and deploys the thin film solar panel of the life support
    unit. The rover can now connect to the life support unit to recharge its
    batteries much faster than using only its own panels, allowing it to do much
    more work. The rover picks up all the other cargo units and then deploys the
    thin film solar panel of the second life support unit and the inflatable
    sections of the living units. The life support unit is connected to the
    living units by a hose that can transport water, air and electricity.
    <br />The life support system is now activated. The rover feeds Martian soil
    into the life support system. Water is extracted from the Martian soil by
    evaporating the subsurface ice particles in an oven. The evaporated water is
    condensed back to its liquid state and stored. Part of the water is used for
    producing oxygen. Nitrogen and argon, filtered from the Martian atmosphere
    make up the other components of the breathable air inside the habitat.

    <br /><br /><b>2024 Departure Crew One</b><br />
    In April 2024, the components of the Mars transit vehicle are launched to
    Earth orbit on receiving the green light on the status of the systems on
    Mars. First, a transit habitat and a Mars lander with an assembly crew
    on-board are launched into an orbit around the Earth. The assembly crew
    docks the Mars lander to the transit habitat. Two propellant stages are
    launched a month later and are also connected. The first Mars crew, now
    fully trained, is launched into the same Earth orbit. In orbit the Mars One
    crew switches places with the assembly crew, who descend back to Earth.
    Engines of the propellant stages are fired and the transit vehicle is
    launched on a Mars transit trajectory. This is the point of no return; the
    crew is now bound to a 210-day flight to Mars.

  <h3>The Body Shop</h3>

  <p>
    The Body Shop International PLC, known as The Body Shop, has a range
    consisting of 1,200 products, including cosmetics and make-up in its 2,500
    franchised stores in 611 countries.
    <br /><br />The company, which has its international headquarters in
    Littlehampton,West Sussex, England, was founded in 1976 by Anita Roddick and
    is now part owned by parent company L'Oréal corporate group. <br /><br />In
    1970 Anita visited “The Body Shop” in California. It was part of a car
    repair shop and they sold naturally-scented soaps and lotions. In 1976,
    Anita opened a similar shop in the UK, using the same business name.
    <br /><br />From its first launch in the UK in 1976, The Body Shop
    experienced rapid growth, expanding at a rate of 50 percent annually.
    <br /><br />The opening of Roddick's first modest shop received early
    attention when the Brighton newspaper, The Evening Argus, carried an article
    about an undertaker with a nearby store who complained about the use of the
    name "The Body Shop." <br /><br />In March 2006, The Body Shop agreed to a
    £652.3 million takeover by L'Oréal. It was reported that Anita and Gordon
    Roddick, who set up The Body Shop 30 years previously, made £130 million
    from the sale. <br /><br />The Body Shop turned increasingly toward social
    and environmental campaigns to promote its business in the late 1980s. In
    1997, Roddick launched a global campaign to raise self-esteem in women and
    against the media stereotyping of women. It focused on unreasonably skinny
    models in the context of rising numbers suffering from bulimia and anorexia.
    <br /><br />Following her death in 2007, Prime Minister Gordon Brown paid
    tribute to Dame Anita, calling her "one of the country's true pioneers" and
    an "inspiration" to businesswomen. He said: "She campaigned for green issues
    for many years before it became fashionable to do so and inspired millions
    to the cause by bringing sustainable products to a mass market. She will be
    remembered not only as a great campaigner but also as a great entrepreneur."
    <br /><br />In October 2009, The Body Shop was awarded a 'Lifetime
    Achievement Award' by the RSPCA in Britain, in recognition of its
    uncompromised policy which ensures ingredients are not tested on animals by
    its suppliers.

  <h3>How to effectively problem-solve</h3>

  <p>Read the text below and answer Questions 27-33</p>

  <p>
    <b>A. </b>In life we can sometimes be overwhelmed by problems. The reason
    behind this is that we wait for problems to find us. We would do far better
    to take a proactive approach, actively seeking out potential problems and
    deciding on which are worth tackling in the first place and taking
    appropriate action. <br /><br /><b>B. </b>Next, one has to resist the
    temptation of going straight into problem analysis and solution. As with the
    first step, this stage is one of the secrets of effective problem-solving.
    Having already decided upon what problems are worthwhile solving, at this
    stage, you need to establish what exactly you are trying to solve.
    <br /><br /><b>C. </b>Now you are ready to get down to work on actually
    tackling the problem you have identified. You need to break down the
    complexity of the problem, stripping away the superficial and getting to the
    causes/issues. Whilst this may take some time and thought, in the long run
    you will reap the benefits of spending time in this more contemplative stage
    of the process. <br /><br /><b>D. </b>There are always more than one ways to
    solve a problem, so take time to create and work upon plenty of creative
    possibilities to the problem. Think of it as a personal brainstorming
    session. However ludicrous a solution may seem initially, write it down
    nevertheless. You never know how effective a solution will be anyway until
    it is put into practice. <br /><br /><b>E. </b>Next you need to make
    choices. You need to weigh up the relative merits and risks of the different
    options you generated in the previous step and decide which to go for. This
    is more of a filtering stage where you weed out the solutions that are less
    likely to work from the more plausible options. <br /><br /><b>F. </b
    >Deciding on which course of action to take is only half the story, though.
    You need to carry the action through in an effective way if you are to
    deliver the outcomes essential to solving the problem you originally
    defined. <br /><br /><b>G. </b>Hopefully once you have reached this stage
    your problem is now a thing of the past. Before you give yourself a
    well-deserved pat on the back though, it is worth taking time out to reflect
    on what you have achieved so far and whether you in fact arrived at the
    anticipated outcome you had hoped for. Any perceived failings on your part
    in implementing the steps can then be addressed, allowing you to take more
    effective action in problem-solving situations in the future.

  <p>
    The function and definition of play
    <br /><br />Play can be defined by three basic criteria: an expression of
    freedom of choice, personal enjoyment and an activity that is an end in
    itself. Its persistence through the ages and across diverse cultures
    demonstrates its functional role in human survival and development. In a
    nutshell, play serves to develop social and cognitive abilities as well as
    acting as a form of self-expression. <br /><br />Within the activity of play
    itself there are several clearly defined types. These types range from
    simple physical play with objects such as baby rattles, to more complex
    cognitive play in games with many rules, such as cards or chess played by
    older children. <br /><br />At the most basic end of the play continuum is
    passive play. Children exhibiting passive play behaviours are not involved
    physically in any play activity themselves. When play behaviour is exhibited
    by other children in their presence, they may be virtually oblivious to it,
    or they may observe but not participate, exhibiting 'onlooker behaviour'.
    <br /><br />At a more engaged level, children will exhibit involved play
    behaviours. To what extent this is a social activity varies greatly,
    depending on where the child is on the socio-developmental spectrum. At one
    end of the spectrum a child may be actively involved in play but alone or in
    parallel to other players. In both cases the child does not interact with
    other children in play activity. As the child learns to engage more with
    other children socially, involved play behaviour will show acknowledgement
    but not complete interaction with other children in associative play and
    more complete engagement with other children in cooperative play which
    requires negotiation skills and turn talking. <br /><br />As a child
    develops language and vocabulary skills, pretend play will evolve. This type
    of play serves to increase memory abilities and enhances reasoning and
    problem-solving abilities. Children at this stage use imagination to
    overcome what adults would term 'problem-solving'. <br /><br />As cognitive
    abilities develop in a child, they will begin to engage in cognitive play.
    Here, at a more complex level of this stage, the child will play games with
    set rules, such as chess or jacks, as well as engaging in dramatic play that
    involves a degree of role play. <br /><br />At three to five years of age,
    when cognitive and social abilities are significantly more developed, a
    child will demonstrate socio-dramatic play. Role play is used and the child
    interacts with other children to narrate and act in stories with fluid
    storylines that they then act out together.
