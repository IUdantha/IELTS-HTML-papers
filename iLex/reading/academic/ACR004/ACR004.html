  <h3>Traditional Maori medicines</h3>

  <p>
    The Maori are the indigenous people of the islands of New Zealand. Their
    traditional medicine, which is believed to date back as far as the 13th
    century, was a system of healing that was passed down through the
    generations orally. It comprised diverse practices and placed an emphasis on
    the spiritual dimension of health. Its practice included remedies made from
    herbs, and physical therapies such as massage to relieve discomfort in the
    muscles and bones.
    <br /><br />Maori systems for treating illness were well developed before
    European arrived in New Zealand in the late 1700s: they had quite detailed
    knowledge of anatomy and recognition of the healing properties of various
    plants. When Europeans first visited New Zealand, the average age of death
    for Maori adults was around 30. However, apart from this, the people were
    fit and healthy, and troubled by few diseases. <br /><br />Illness was often
    seen as spiritually based. Maori saw themselves as guardians of the earth,
    and the focus of their existence was to remain at one with the natural and
    supernatural world. Rather than a medical problem, sickness was often viewed
    as a symptom of disharmony with natures. <br /><br />In Maori culture,
    illnesses were divided into diseases of the gods (mate atua) and physical
    diseases (mate tangata). Diseases sent by the gods were often attributed to
    attacks by evil spirits, because the person had broken a religious rule. For
    instance, for Maori, Places where people had died, or places where their
    ancestors were buried were sacred, so if someone took food from a river
    where someone had died, or took a stick form a tree that had held their
    ancestor's bones and placed it on a cooking fire, it was believed that the
    gods could punish them for their disrespectful acts by making them SICK.
    <br /><br />More than 200 plants were used medicinally by Maori. The leaves
    of the flax plant were used to treat skin infections and food poisoning, and
    the hard part of the leaf was also used as a splint or brace for broken
    bones and injured backs. Flax fibers were used along with a sharpened stick
    to sew up bad cuts. The bark and leaves of the pepper tree were used to heal
    cuts, wounds and stomach pain. People who had toothache were instructed to
    chew the leaves of this same tree, and this was found to be of considerable
    benefit. The pepper tree was also used in vapor baths to treat people with
    painful joints. <br /><br />Colonization by European in the 1800s had a
    significant effect on traditional Maori healing. Europeans brought many new
    diseases with them which Maori healers had limited ability to combat. Though
    Western medicine was also relatively ineffectual at the time, this failure
    still strongly affected Maori confidence in their healers. Some western
    missionaries attributed the spread of disease to the fact the Maori did not
    believe in Christianity, and as Maori healers appeared powerless, many Maori
    accepted this explanation and turned to Christianity. Over time the schools
    of higher learning which ahd trained healers started to close and the
    tradition of the Maori healer declined. <br /><br />From the late 20th
    century, there was renewed Maori interest in their traditional medicine.
    This was due to several factors. There was a resurgence of all aspects of
    Maori culture in New Zealand. Furthermore, people started to be less
    trusting of Western medicine. Statistics from the 1970s came out revealing
    that Maori health continued to be poorer than that of other New Zealanders.
    There were also problems with access to health care for Maori. Additionally,
    there was and still a today a perceived lack of a spiritual dimension in
    Western health services. <br /><br />Although Maori today largely accepted
    Western concepts of health and illness, and use the mainstream health
    system, there is significant demand for traditional medicine. This is true
    for unusual illnesses, or those that fail to respond to standard medical
    treatment, but also for common ailments such as the cold and influenza.
    <br /><br />Today's healers differ significantly from those of old times.
    Training is highly variable, usually informal, and often less tribally bound
    than the rigorous education of the traditional houses of higher learning.
    Many modern healers work in urban clinics, some alongside mainstream health
    professionals. They experiment, incorporating knowledge from Western and
    other medical systems. As a result, their modern day work has no standard
    system of diagnosis or widespread agreement about treatments. Despite this,
    many healers are recognized as having knowledge and ability that has been
    passed down from their ancestors. The Maori language is also seen as
    important by many of those receiving treatment.

  <h3>Chinstrap Penguin Population In The Last 50 Years</h3>

  <p>
    <b>A.</b> The chinstrap penguin has a cap of black plumage, a white face,
    and a continuous band of black feathers extending from one side of the head
    to the other, the “chinstrap.” The northern part of the Antarctic Peninsula,
    several Antarctic and subantarctic islands, and the uninhabited Balleny
    Islands between Antarctica and New Zealand are the habitats of the species.
    <br /><br /><b>B.</b> Antarctic penguin colonies in some parts of the
    Antarctic have declined over the last 50 years, mostly because of climate
    change, researchers say. The colonies of chinstrap penguins, also known as
    ringed or bearded penguins, have dramatically dropped since they were last
    surveyed almost 50 years ago, scientists discovered. The findings became
    surprising because, until now, the chinstraps have been deemed of “least
    concern” by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). “We
    really didn’t know what to expect, and then we found this huge decline on
    Elephant Island,” Noah Strycker, an ornithologist and penguin researcher at
    Stony Brook University, told CNN from Greenpeace’s Esperanza ship in the
    Antarctic. “It’s a little bit worrying as it means that something is
    shifting in the ecosystem and the fall in penguin numbers is reflecting that
    shift.” <br /><br /><b>C.</b> Every colony of Elephant Island, which is a
    crucial penguin habitat northeast of the Antarctic Peninsula, when surveyed,
    experienced a population fall, as per the independent researchers who joined
    a Greenpeace expedition to the region. Elephant Island was last surveyed in
    1971, and there were 122,550 pairs of penguins across all colonies. However,
    the recent count revealed just 52,786 pairs with a drop of almost 60%. On
    Elephant Island, the size of the population change varied from colony to
    colony, and the most significant decline was recorded at a colony known as
    Chinstrap Camp, which is 77%. <br /><br /><b>D.</b> Just the days after
    temperatures hit an all-time high in the Antarctic with 18.3 Celsius (64.94
    Fahrenheit) recorded on February 6, the latest study is published. The
    previous high 17.5 C (63.5 F) was recorded in March 2015. Scientists
    recorded the temperature at Argentina’s Esperanza research station,
    according to the meteorological agency of the country. <br /><br /><b>E.</b>
    The reduced sea ice and warmer oceans due to climate change have led to less
    krill, the main component of the penguins’ diet. “Climate change is probably
    the underlying factor, and the effects are rippling through the food chain,”
    Strycker said. “Penguins, seals, and whales all depend on krill, which
    depends on ice. So if climate change affects the ice, that impacts on
    everything else.” Heather J. Lynch, associate professor of ecology and
    evolution at New York’s Stony Brook University and one of the expedition’s
    research leads, said: “Such significant declines in penguin numbers suggest
    that the Southern Ocean’s ecosystem has fundamentally changed in the last 50
    years and that the impacts of this are rippling up the food web to species
    like chinstrap penguins.” She added that “while several factors may have a
    role to play, all the evidence we have pointed to climate change as being
    responsible for the changes we are seeing.” <br /><br /><b>F.</b> However,
    some good news was also there, as the researchers reported an increase in
    gentoo penguins population in neighbouring colonies, beyond Elephant Island.
    “It’s interesting, as a tale of two penguins on the Antarctic Peninsula,”
    said Strycker. “Gentoo is a species from further north and they appear to be
    colonizing the area and are actually increasing in numbers.” <br /><br /><b
      >G.</b
    >
    The Greenpeace ship Esperanza has been documenting the threat to the oceans
    worldwide and taking the scientists for travelling abroad. For the first
    time, the Low Island in the South Shetland Islands, north of the Antarctic
    Peninsula, has been surveyed properly. The manual and drone techniques are
    used by the researchers, from Stony Brook and Northeastern University in
    Boston, to survey a series of significant but relatively unknown colonies of
    chinstrap penguin here. The results are, however, not yet available.
    Greenpeace has been campaigning for the three Antarctic sanctuaries that it
    would establish to offer protection to many of the colonies surveyed. These
    would be off-limits to humans. <br /><br /><b>H.</b> Louisa Casson,
    Greenpeace Oceans Campaigner, said in a statement: “Penguins are an iconic
    species, but this new research shows how the climate emergency is decimating
    their numbers and having far-reaching impacts on wildlife in the most remote
    corners of Earth. This is a critical year for our oceans. “Governments must
    respond to the science and agree on a strong Global Ocean Treaty at the
    United Nations this spring that can create a network of ocean sanctuaries to
    protect marine life and help these creatures adapt to our rapidly changing
    climate.”

  <h3>
    Why Do We Touch Strangers So Much? A History Of The Handshake Offers Clues
  </h3>

  <p>
    For thousands of years, the handshake has been used for different purposes.
    <br /><br />There is a lot that can be conveyed in a handshake, a kiss, or a
    hug. Throughout history, such a greeting was used to signal friendship,
    finalize a business transaction, or indicate religious devotion. Touching
    strangers, however, can also transmit other, less beneficial shared
    outcomes—like disease outbreaks. <br /><br />As fears about COVID-19, or
    coronavirus, mount, France has warned its citizens to pause their famous
    cheek kisses, and across the world, business deals are being sealed with an
    elbow bump. But with histories tracing back thousands of years, both
    greetings are likely too entrenched to be so easily halted. <br /><br />A
    popular theory on the handshake’s origin is that it began as a gesture of
    peace. Grasping hands proved one was not holding a weapon—and shaking them
    was a way to ensure a partner had nothing hiding up their sleeve. So far,
    there has not been any reliable evidence to prove this assumption.
    Throughout the ancient world, the handshake appears on vases, gravestones,
    and stone slabs in scenes of weddings, gods making deals, young warriors
    departing for war, and the newly dead’s arrival to the afterlife. In the
    literary canon, it stretches to the Iliad and the Odyssey. <br /><br />The
    handshake’s catch-all utility, used in friendship, romance, and business
    alike, makes interpretation difficult. “The handshake continues to be a
    popular image today because we too see it as a complex and ambiguous motif,”
    writes art historian Glenys Davies in an analysis of its use in classical
    art. <br /><br />In America, it is likely that the handshake’s popularity
    was propelled by 18th century Quakers. In their efforts to eschew the
    hierarchy and social rank, they found the handshake a more democratic form
    of greeting to the then-common bow, curtsy, or hat doffing. “In their place,
    Quakers put the practice of the handshake, extended to everyone regardless
    of station, as we still do,” writes historian Michael Zuckerman.
    <br /><br />There may be a scientific explanation for its lasting power. In
    a 2015 study, researchers in Israel filmed handshakes between hundreds of
    strangers and found nearly a quarter of participants sniffed their hands
    afterwards. They theorized that a handshake might be unconsciously used to
    detect chemical signals, and possibly as a means of communication—just as
    other animals do by smelling each other. <br /><br />The kiss-as-greeting
    has a similarly rich history. It was incorporated into early Christianity
    and used in religious ceremonies. “In his Epistle to the Romans, St. Paul
    instructed followers to ‘salute one another with a holy kiss,’” writes Andy
    Scott in the book One Kiss or Two: In Search of the Perfect Greeting. In the
    Middle Ages, a kiss was used as a sign of fidelity and to seal agreements
    like property transfers. <br /><br />Today, a swift kiss on the cheek known
    in French as “la bise,” is a standard greeting in much of the world. The
    word may have originated with the Romans, who had a different term for each
    type of kiss and called the polite version “basium.” In Paris, two kisses
    are common. In Provence expect three, and four is the norm in the Loire
    Valley. The cheek kiss is also common in countries like Egypt, where three
    kisses is customary, Latin America, and the Philippines. It is thought that
    during the plague in the 14th century, la bise may have stopped and was not
    revived again until 400 years later, after the French Revolution. In 2009,
    la bise was temporarily paused as swine flu became a concern. At the end of
    February, the French Health Minister advised against it as the coronavirus
    cases increased. “The reduction in social contacts of a physical nature is
    advised,” he said. “That includes the practice of the bise.” <br /><br />In
    her book Don’t Look, Don’t Touch, behavioural scientist Val Curtis of the
    London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, says that one possible
    reason for the kiss and handshake as a greeting is to signify that the other
    person is trusted enough to share germs with. Because of this, the practice
    can go in and out of style depending on public health concerns.
    <br /><br />In a 1929 study, a nurse named Leila Given wrote an article in
    the American Journal of Nursing lamenting the loss of the last generation’s
    “finger-tipping and the high handshake” customs in favour of a handshake.
    She warned that hands “are agents of bacterial transfer” and cited early
    studies showing that a handshake could easily spread germs. In conclusion,
    she recommended that Americans adopt the Chinese custom at the time of
    shaking one’s own hands together when greeting a friend. “At least our
    bacteria would then stay at home,” she wrote.
