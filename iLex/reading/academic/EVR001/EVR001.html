  <h2>Fatal Attraction</h2>
  <p>
    Evolutionist Charles Darwin first marveled at flesh-eating plants in the
    mid-19th century. Today, biologists, using 21st-century tools to study cells
    and DNA, are beginning to understand how these plants hunt, eat and digest -
    and how such bizarre adaptations arose in the first place.
  </p>
  A
  <p>
    The leaves of the Venus flytrap plant are covered in hairs. When an insect
    brushes against them, this triggers a tiny electric charge, which travels
    down tunnels in the leaf and opens up pores in the leaf's cell membranes.
    Water surges from the cells on the inside of the leaf to those on the
    outside, causing the leaf to rapidly flip in shape from convex to concave,
    like a soft contact lens. As the leaves flip, they snap together, trapping
    the insect in their sharp-toothed jaws.
  </p>
  B
  <p>
    The bladderwort has an equally sophisticated way of setting its underwater
    trap. It pumps water out of tiny bag-like bladders, making a vacuum inside.
    When small creatures swim past, they bend the hairs on the bladder, causing
    a flap to open. The low pressure sucks water in, carrying the animal along
    with it. In one five-hundredth of a second, the door swings shut again. The
    Drosera sundew, meanwhile, has a thick, sweet liquid oozing from its leaves,
    which first attracts insects, then holds them fast before the leaves snap
    shut. Pitcher plants use yet another strategy, growing long tube-shaped
    leaves to imprison their prey. Raffles' pitcher plant, from the jungles of
    Borneo, produces nectar that both lures insects and forms a slick surface on
    which they can't get a grip. Insects that land on the rim of the pitcher
    slide on the liquid and tumble in.
  </p>
  C
  <p>
    Many carnivorous plants secrete enzymes to penetrate the hard exoskeleton of
    insects so they can absorb nutrients from inside their prey. But the purple
    pitcher plant, which lives in bogs and infertile sandy soils in North
    America, enlists other organisms to process its food. It is home to an
    intricate food web of mosquito larvae, midges and bacteria, many of which
    can survive only in this unique habitat. These animals shred the prey that
    fall into the pitcher, and the smaller organisms feed on the debris.
    Finally, the plant absorbs the nutrients released.
  </p>
  D
  <p>
    While such plants clearly thrive on being carnivorous, the benefits of
    eating flesh are not the ones you might expect. Carnivorous animals such as
    ourselves use the carbon in protein and the fat in meat to build muscles and
    store energy. Carnivorous plants instead draw nitrogen, phosphorus, and
    other critical nutrients from their prey in order to build light-harvesting
    enzymes. Eating animals, in other words, lets carnivorous plants do what all
    plants do: carry out photosynthesis, that is, grow by harnessing energy
    directly from the sun.
  </p>
  E
  <p>
    Carnivorous plants are, in fact, very inefficient at converting sunlight
    into tissue. This is because of all the energy they expend to make the
    equipment to catch animals – the enzymes, the pumps, and so on. A pitcher or
    a flytrap cannot carry out much photosynthesis because, unlike plants with
    ordinary leaves, they do not have flat solar panels that can grab lots of
    sunlight. There are, however, some special conditions in which the benefits
    of being carnivorous do outweigh the costs. The poor soil of bogs, for
    example, offers little nitrogen and phosphorus, so carnivorous plants enjoy
    an advantage over plants that obtain these nutrients by more conventional
    means. Bogs are also flooded with sunshine, so even an inefficient
    carnivorous plant can photosynthesise enough light to survive.
  </p>
  F
  <p>
    Evolution has repeatedly made this trade-off. By comparing the DNA of
    carnivorous plants with other species, scientists have found that they
    evolved independently on at least six separate occasions. Some carnivorous
    plants that look nearly identical turn out to be only distantly related. The
    two kinds of pitcher plants - the tropical genus Nepenthes and the North
    American Sarracenia - have, surprisingly, evolved from different ancestors,
    although both grow deep pitchershaped leaves and employ the same strategy
    for capturing prey.
  </p>
  G
  <p>
    In several cases, scientists can see how complex carnivorous plants evolved
    from simpler ones. Venus flytraps, for example, share an ancestor with
    Portuguese sundews, which only catch prey passively, via 'flypaper' glands
    on their stems. They share a more recent ancestor with Drosera sundews,
    which can also curl their leaves over their prey. Venus flytraps appear to
    have evolved an even more elaborate version of this kind of trap, complete
    with jaw-like leaves.
  </p>
  H
  <p>
    Unfortunately, the adaptations that enable carnivorous plants to thrive in
    marginal habitats also make them exquisitely sensitive. Agricultural run-off
    and pollution from power plants are adding extra nitrogen to many bogs in
    North America. Carnivorous plants are so finely tuned to low levels of
    nitrogen that this extra fertilizer is overloading their systems, and they
    eventually burn themselves out and die.
  </p>
  <!-- --------------- changes: There is possibly a mistake here (add I) --------------- -->
  <p>
    Humans also threaten carnivorous plants in other ways. The black market
    trade in exotic carnivorous plants is so vigorous now that botanists are
    keeping the location of some rare species a secret. But even if the poaching
    of carnivorous plants can be halted, they will continue to suffer from other
    assaults. In the pine savannah of North Carolina, the increasing suppression
    of fires is allowing other plants to grow too quickly and outcompete the
    flytraps in their native environment. Good news, perhaps, for flies. But a
    loss for all who, like Darwin, delight in the sheer inventiveness of
    evolution.

  <h2>Communication in science</h2>

  A
  <p>
    Science plays an increasingly significant role in people’s lives, making the
    faithful communication of scientific developments more important than ever.
    Yet such communication is fraught with challenges that can easily distort
    discussions, leading to unnecessary confusion and misunderstandings.
  </p>
  B
  <p>
    Some problems stem from the esoteric nature of current research and the
    associated difficulty of finding sufficiently faithful terminology.
    Abstraction and complexity are not signs that a given scientific direction
    is wrong, as some commentators have suggested, but are instead a tribute to
    the success of human ingenuity in meeting the increasingly complex
    challenges that nature presents. They can, however, make communication more
    difficult. But many of the biggest challenges for science reporting arise
    because in areas of evolving research, scientists themselves often only
    partly understand the full implications of any particular advance or
    development. Since that dynamic applies to most of the scientific
    developments that directly affect people’s lives global warming, cancer
    research, diet studies – learning how to overcome it is critical to spurring
    a more informed scientific debate among the broader public.
  </p>
  C
  <p>
    Ambiguous word choices are the source of some misunderstandings. Scientists
    often employ colloquial terminology, which they then assign a specific
    meaning that is impossible to fathom without proper training. The term
    “relativity,” for example, is intrinsically misleading. Many interpret the
    theory to mean that everything is relative and there are no absolutes. Yet
    although the measurements any observer makes depend on his coordinates and
    reference frame, the physical phenomena he measures have an invariant
    description that transcends that observer’s particular coordinates.
    Einstein’s theory of relativity is really about finding an invariant
    description of physical phenomena. True, Einstein agreed with the idea that
    his theory would have been better named “Invarianten theorie.” But the term
    “relativity” was already entrenched at the time for him to change.
  </p>
  D
  <p>
    “The uncertainty principle” is another frequently abused term. It is
    sometimes interpreted as a limitation on observers and their ability to make
    measurements.
  </p>
  E
  <p>
    But it is not about intrinsic limitations on any one particular measurement;
    it is about the inability to precisely measure particular pairs of
    quantities simultaneously? The first interpretation is perhaps more engaging
    from a philosophical or political perspective. It’s just not what the
    science is about.
  </p>
  F
  <p>
    Even the word “theory” can be a problem. Unlike most people, who use the
    word to describe a passing conjecture that they often regard as suspect,
    physicists have very specific ideas in mind when they talk about theories.
    For physicists, theories entail a definite physical framework embodied in a
    set of fundamental assumptions about the world that lead to a specific set
    of equations and predictions – ones that are borne out by successful
    predictions. Theories aren’t necessarily shown to be correct or complete
    immediately. Even Einstein took the better part of a decade to develop the
    correct version of his theory of general relativity. But eventually both the
    ideas and the measurements settle down and theories are either proven
    correct, abandoned or absorbed into other, more encompassing theories.
  </p>
  G
  <p>
    “Global warming” is another example of problematic terminology.
    Climatologists predict more drastic fluctuations in temperature and rainfall
    – not necessarily that every place will be warmer. The name sometimes
    subverts the debate, since it lets people argue that their winter was worse,
    so how could there be global warming? Clearly “global climate change” would
    have been a better name. But not all problems stem solely from poor word
    choices. Some stem from the intrinsically complex nature of much of modern
    science. Science sometimes transcends this limitation: remarkably, chemists
    were able to detail the precise chemical processes involved in the
    destruction of the ozone layer, making the evidence that chlorofluorocarbon
    gases (Freon, for example) were destroying the ozone layer indisputable.
  </p>
  H

  <p>
    A better understanding of the mathematical significance of results and less
    insistence on a simple story would help to clarify many scientific
    discussions. For several months, Harvard was tortured months, Harvard was
    tortured by empty debates over the relative intrinsic scientific abilities
    of men and women. One of the more amusing aspects of the discussion was that
    those who believed in the differences and those who didn’t use the same
    evidence about gender-specific special ability? How could that be? The
    answer is that the data shows no substantial effects. Social factors might
    account for these tiny differences, which in any case have an unclear
    connection to scientific ability. Not much of a headline when phrased that
    way, is it? Each type of science has its own source of complexity and
    potential for miscommunication. Yet there are steps we can take to improve
    public understanding in all cases. The first would be to inculcate greater
    understanding and acceptance of indirect scientific evidence. The
    information from an unmanned space mission is no less legitimate than the
    information from one in which people are on board.
  </p>
  I
  <p>
    This doesn’t mean questioning an interpretation, but it also doesn’t mean
    equating indirect evidence with blind belief, as people sometimes suggest.
    Second, we might need different standards for evaluating science with urgent
    policy implications than research with the purely theoretical value. When
    scientists say they are not certain about their predictions, it doesn’t
    necessarily mean they’ve found nothing substantial. It would be better if
    scientists were more open about the mathematical significance of their
    results and if the public didn’t treat math as quite so scary; statistics
    and errors, which tell us the uncertainty in a measurement, give us the
    tools to evaluate new developments fairly.
  </p>
  J
  <p>
    But most important, people have to recognize that science can be complex. If
    we accept only simple stories, the description will necessarily be
    distorted. When advances are subtle or complicated, scientists should be
    willing to go the extra distance to give proper explanations and the public
    should be more patient about the truth. Even so, some difficulties are
    unavoidable. Most developments reflect work in progress, so the story is
    complex because no one yet knows the big picture.
