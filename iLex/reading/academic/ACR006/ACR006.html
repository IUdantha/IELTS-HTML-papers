  <h3>The Secret Schizoid</h3>

  <p>
    It is psychiatrist Ralph Klein who was credited with first coining the
    phrase ‘secret schizoid’. Unlike the overtly schizoid or schizotypal
    individual who is characterised by aloofness, coldness and indifference, the
    secret schizoid may present himself as an engaging and interactive
    individual according to Klein. Thus, Klein argues, there are not one but two
    distinct schizoid personality types: the overt schizoid and the covert
    schizoid.
    <br /><br />Covert schizoids are difficult, on first glance, to identify.
    They have erected a convincing defensive barrier of social assuredness,
    engaging with the external reality, superficially at least. This engagement
    might, to the casual onlooker, appear quite normal. However, if quizzed
    about their behaviour, covert schizoids will probably reveal that they are
    still, on a deeper level, withdrawn from the real world. Their outward
    persona should be viewed, therefore, as little more than an act; the actual
    personality only being revealed in a safe place within the confines of the
    schizoids’ own mind; in other words, only ever known to the schizoids
    themselves. <br /><br />The covert schizoid, as Fairbairn identified as long
    ago as 1940, is capable of ‘schizoid exhibitionism’; covert schizoids can
    appear to express a lot of feeling and make impressive social contacts
    without revealing anything of great significance about themselves. In
    effect, they disown the ‘character’ they play in public - the very credible
    front they put up -preserving their real personality intact. What the
    schizoids fear most is the consequences of emotional intimacy, so by
    erecting an invisible barrier between their public persona and their real
    self, the schizoids can avoid ever having to confront this fear and yet lead
    a relatively active and inclusive lifestyle. <br /><br />Is the secret
    schizoid schizophrenic? Certainly not. Though the two fall within the realms
    of the same family of illnesses, the schizophrenic personality disorder is
    far more destructive. Whereas schizoids can, depending on the severity of
    their affliction, function fairly normally and even form relationships with
    others (based on intellectual, physical, familial, occupational or
    recreational, but most certainly not emotional, activities), and have a
    relatively fair grasp of reality, schizophrenics are plagued by
    hallucinations, delusions and disorganised thinking, all of which are likely
    to affect their functional capacity in a very negative way. It is true,
    however, that a family background of schizophrenia leaves one more
    vulnerable to or likely to develop a schizoid or schizotypal personality.
    <br /><br />The causes of schizoid personality disorder are not clear, but
    it is theorised that an absence of parental affection and attention during
    early childhood may encourage the defensive tendencies and fear of intimacy
    that schizoids exhibit. It is also hypothesised that so-called secret
    schizoids are highly intelligent and have learned to develop their act as an
    effective coping mechanism which allows them to have the superficial
    relationships they so often crave without compromising that which they hold
    most valuable - their privacy. <br /><br />One of the most damaging aspects
    of life as a secret schizoid can be what is termed 'depersonalisation’,
    namely, the loss of one’s sense of identity and individuality. Without the
    feedback which may be gleaned from real interpersonal relationships,
    schizoids’ perception of self may become skewed, or worse, they may begin to
    lose all self-perception. Effectively, this leaves the individuals feeling a
    deep sense of emptiness. Their emotional needs continue to go unfulfilled
    despite the fact that, on the face of it, the secret schizoids are leading
    an active and engaging lifestyle. The schizoids begin to question who or
    what they are and, tragically, yearn for the emotional attachment needed to
    confirm or reaffirm their perceptions of self an emotional attachment that
    they are incapable of seeking. <br /><br />The public perception of the
    schizoid is misinformed at best. Just because they suffer from the illness
    does not mean secret schizoids are apathetic, dispassionate or indifferent.
    In actual fact, the schizoids can experience very strong emotions, but do so
    in both the comfort and discomfort of their own mind; the comfort of not
    feeling emotionally violated and the discomfort of not being able to share
    one’s inner fears with another person in order to alleviate them. Schizoids
    are often extremely sensitive people and their defensive front exists for
    the sole purpose of protecting themselves from criticism with which they are
    incapable of coping.

        As they are unwilling to try to overcome their innate fear of emotional

        understanding of

        are not inclined to suffer from the same incapacitating symptoms, like
        hallucinations, delusions and disorganised thinking, that schizophrenics
        do.<br /><br />

  <h3>Fortunes of the Maori People</h3>

  <p>
    The islands of New Zealand, or Aotearoa, as its first inhabitants named
    them, first became populated at some point not long before 1300 AD. The
    indigenous people of New Zealand, known by the name they gave themselves -
    the Maori - are descendant from eastern Polynesia, whence they came in
    several waves. They formed a tribal society based on Polynesian social
    customs and organisation, but, over time, would develop a unique language
    and culture all of their own, complete with a rich mythology, distinctive
    crafts and performing arts, in splendid isolation from the rest of the
    world.
    <br /><br />Europeans did not arrive in New Zealand until the beginning of
    the 17th century, and although their coming did not immediately bring the
    great change one might have assumed (in fact, the islanders and the
    Europeans lived fairly harmoniously together for some years, trading, and
    sharing knowledge and customs), it would, ultimately, usher in enormous
    upheaval. Over the years, the Maori began to adopt the settlers' ways, and
    many aspects of indigenous culture were compromised as a result.
    <br /><br />It was following the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840,
    which gave Britain a mandate to govern New Zealand and bestowed the rights
    of subjects of the British monarch on the Maori, that the rumblings of
    discontent began in earnest. <br /><br />At first, what was being disputed
    was the exact terms of the treaty. The translation presented to the Maori in
    their native tongue had a number of discrepancies in it compared to the
    English version. Crucially, there was no mention of a total surrender of
    power and control to the British monarch, so it is highly unlikely that the
    Maori actually agreed with or consented to what they were signing when they
    put pen to paper on the anglicised version. <br /><br />This, and the fact
    that only about one-third of the Maori tribes had actually signed off on the
    treaty, led to the first dispute, which soon turned bloody. Inevitably, the
    British forces, with their superior fire power, would prevail in the ensuing
    conflict. The conflict itself, though, did not take a harsh toll on either
    side in terms of fatalities. What really decimated the Maori population was
    disease. The Maori were not biologically equipped for the diseases they
    would contract as a result of contact with the settlers. They did not have
    sufficient natural immunity to combat flu and measles, which, it is
    estimated, together killed anywhere between ten and fifty percent of the
    population. Other illnesses such as typhoid, scarlet fever and whooping
    cough also took their toll. <br /><br />The Maori population went into
    serious decline from the mid-1800s right up until the start of the 20th
    century when it began to stage a revival of sorts, thanks in part to efforts
    by the government of New Zealand, motivated by a desire to make amends for
    previous wrongdoing, to help the Maori return to prosperity. The 20th
    century saw a renaissance of Maori culture and a recovery of the population,
    which is continuing into the new millennium. <br /><br />By 2015, an
    estimated 660,000 New Zealanders could claim direct Maori descent - roughly
    fifteen percent of the total population. Maori, the language, is spoken, to
    some extent, by about a quarter of this group, or four percent of the total
    population of New Zealand, and the Maori people are active in all aspects of
    domestic affairs. Maori words have become part of the lexicon of the local
    vernacular, New Zealand English, and many towns and regions across the
    country are known by their traditional Maori names. <br /><br />That said,
    the Maori people still face some serious challenges today; challenges
    chiefly of a socio-economic nature. The Maori have a lower life expectancy,
    inferior earning power, higher crime levels and more health problems than
    all the other ethnic groups on the islands. They are also serial
    underachievers educationally. However, steps are being taken to redress the
    balance and improve the prospects of Maori youths going forward. One area in
    which they have excelled, and something which has come to almost symbolise
    the Maori's great sense of pride and warrior tradition, is the game of
    rugby. The Maori Haka has become synonymous with the All Blacks, New
    Zealand's national rugby team. This traditional Maori dance is now showcased
    around the world in performances by the international rugby players, which
    precede all games they play in.

  <h3>The Kuiper Belt</h3>

  <p>
    Located in a region of the Solar System beyond the planets (from 30 AU at
    Neptune’s orbit to circa 55 AU from the Sun), the Kuiper Belt, or
    Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt I as many scientists prefer to call it, is similar to
    an asteroid belt though far greater in size, being 20 times as wide and
    potentially 200 times as massive. Like asteroid I belts, the Kuiper is
    composed of small celestial bodies, the scattered remnants - the leftover
    junk if you like - from the formation of the Solar System, but unlike
    asteroid belts whose objects are largely composed of rock and metal, the
    Kuiper’s objects consist of what are termed ‘frozen volatiles’: methane,
    ammonia and water in ice form, for example. Another significant
    differentiating factor between the Kuiper and asteroid belts is the presence
    in the former of at least four dwarf planets, the most well-known of which
    is Pluto, which, until 2006, was actually classed as a planet in its own
    right. The belt has also previously been home to other large objects such as
    Saturn’s moon Phoebe and Neptune’s Triton, which originated in the region
    before coming under the influence of the gravitational forces of their
    respective planets. <br /><br />Though the existence of a phenomenon like
    the belt had been hypothesised for some time, its existence wasn’t
    officially confirmed until 1992, since when over one thousand Kuiper Belt
    objects (KBOs) have been officially observed. On the basis of what we know
    about the region, it is speculated that the actual number of KBOs measuring
    over 100km in diameter is far in excess of the 1000 objects already
    confirmed and closer to a figure in the region of 70,000. Initially, it was
    speculated that the Kuiper region was responsible for the appearance of most
    periodic comets (comets whose orbit lasts less than 200 years), but studies
    conducted in the mid-90s appear to contradict this assumption and cast the
    Kuiper region as one which is dynamically stable and, thus, not the
    repository of periodic comets it was originally assumed to be. Instead, the
    true source of periodic comets is now thought to be in the farther regions
    of the Solar System outside of the Kuiper Belt in an area referred to as the
    scattered disc, thought to have been created by the outward motion of
    Neptune several billion years ago. Scattered-disc objects are KBO-like
    bodies with orbits which take them as far as 100 AU from the Sun, far beyond
    the 50 AU boundary of the Kuiper Belt itself. <br /><br />Pluto Is the
    largest-known Kuiper Belt object and also the tenth most massive body
    observed directly orbiting the Sun. It was reclassified a dwarf planet after
    it was discovered to be more similar compositionally to KBOs than the major
    planets, being comprised of rock and Ice. Its orbital period is also
    identical to that of another group of KBOs, referred to as plutinos in its
    honor. Alongside Pluto, a further three dwarf planets have now been observed
    within the Kuiper Belt, and these are collectively referred to as plutoids:
    another patent tribute to the former planet. <br /><br />The Kuiper’s close
    proximity to Neptune has a profound effect on its structure due to the
    consequent orbital resonance (gravitational influence) at work on it.
    Neptune’s gravity destabilises the orbits of objects lying within certain
    regions of the Kuiper, doing one of two things: either sending them farther
    out into the scattered disc region of interstellar space, or into the linear
    Solar System. For this reason, the Kuiper is characterised by a series of
    pronounced gaps in its current layout, similar to the gaps present in the
    asteroid belt on which gravitational forces are also constantly at work.
    <br /><br />The classical belt is the region of the Kuiper between 42-48 AU.
    Here the gravitational influence of Neptune is negligible, so KBOs can exist
    in their original orbits, largely unaffected. This region accounts for about
    two-thirds of all KBOs observed to date. Within the classical belt are two
    distinct populations of KBO defined by their differing orbits. The
    ‘dynamically cold’ population has orbits which are nearly circular, much as
    planets do. The ‘dynamically hot' population is characterised by more
    pronounced elliptical orbits. Not only are the populations at odds in their
    orbits, they are also compositionally distinct. The cold population has a
    red hue not evident in the hot population (the names cold and hot are not in
    any way indicative of temperature). It is thought that the hot population
    therefore formed in a different region near Jupiter before being ejected
    outward by movements among the gas giants, whereas the cold formed roughly
    where it is still situated, just outside of the orbital range of Neptune.
