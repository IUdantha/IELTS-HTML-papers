  <h3>URBAN TREES</h3>

  <p>
    The presence of street trees can dramatically improve urban environments in
    a variety of ways <br /><br />Street trees are not only a key component of
    the urban landscape, but also provide numerous environmental, economic and
    social benefits. Despite this, in many towns and cities, they are frequently
    seen as a problem, and in recent years, large numbers have been removed or
    severely cut back. <br /><br />Street trees are trees that are located on
    public land along streets and boulevards, and in parks. They are usually the
    responsibility of local governments, although in some cases they may be
    privately owned. In the past, street trees were planted and maintained by
    local authorities for the public good. However, with the increasing
    privatisation of public space, the responsibility for street trees has
    shifted from the public to the private domain, and they are now often seen
    as a liability. <br /><br />Street trees can make urban areas much more
    pleasant places in which to live, and there are many studies to show that
    they are associated with a wide range of benefits. For example, they remove
    pollutants from the air, provide shade, and reduce the urban heat island
    effect, which is caused by hard surfaces such as concrete and asphalt
    storing heat from the sun. They also improve water quality, reduce flooding,
    and decrease the amount of water that ends up in drainage systems. In
    addition, they can save energy by shading buildings and reducing the need
    for air conditioning in summer. <br /><br />Street trees also have
    significant social benefits. They make streets more pleasant to walk along,
    and provide shade and shelter for pedestrians. They also act as a buffer
    between pedestrians and traffic, and reduce traffic noise. In addition, they
    can provide a sense of place and identity, and improve the quality of life
    for residents. Studies have shown that street trees can reduce crime,
    improve mental health, and increase property values. They can also provide
    habitat for wildlife, and improve biodiversity in urban areas.
    <br /><br />Despite these benefits, street trees are often seen as a
    problem. One reason for this is that they can cause damage to
    infrastructure, such as roads, footpaths and underground services. This is
    often due to the fact that they are planted in small pits with limited space
    for root growth, which can lead to roots damaging infrastructure as they
    search for water and nutrients. In addition, street trees can be seen as a
    nuisance because they drop leaves, fruit and branches, which can be messy
    and require cleaning up. They can also block light and views, and interfere
    with overhead wires and signage. <br /><br />Another reason why street trees
    are seen as a problem is that they can be expensive to maintain. They
    require regular pruning to keep them in good condition, and to prevent them
    from interfering with infrastructure. They also need to be watered,
    fertilised and protected from pests and diseases. In addition, they can be
    damaged by vehicles, vandalism and extreme weather events, which can result
    in costly repairs or replacement. <br /><br />In recent years, there has
    been a trend towards removing street trees, or replacing them with smaller,
    more manageable species. This is often done to reduce maintenance costs, and
    to prevent damage to infrastructure. However, this can result in a loss of
    the benefits that street trees provide. In some cases, street trees are
    replaced with artificial trees, which do not provide the same benefits as
    real trees. <br /><br />There are a number of ways in which the benefits of
    street trees can be maximised, and the problems minimised. One way is to
    plant the right tree in the right place. This means choosing tree species
    that are suitable for the local climate, soil and growing conditions, and
    that will not cause damage to infrastructure. It also means planting trees
    in locations where they will provide the most benefits, such as along
    streets with high pedestrian traffic, or in areas with high levels of air
    pollution. <br /><br />Another way to maximise the benefits of street trees
    is to provide them with adequate space and resources to grow. This means
    planting them in large pits with good quality soil, and providing them with
    regular watering, fertilising and pruning. It also means protecting them
    from damage by vehicles, vandalism and extreme weather events.
    <br /><br />In conclusion, street trees are a vital component of the urban
    landscape, and provide numerous environmental, economic and social benefits.
    However, they are often seen as a problem, and are frequently removed or
    severely cut back. By planting the right tree in the right place, and
    providing them with adequate space and resources to grow, the benefits of
    street trees can be maximised, and the problems minimised.

    <b><span style="color: red">Choose ONE WORD ONLY</span></b> from the passage
    for each answer.
  </p>
  <p>Write your answers in boxes <b>1–7</b> on your answer sheet.</p>

  <p>
    Street trees enhance urban areas by offering various ecological, financial,
    and societal
    <input type="text" name="q1" placeholder="1" style="width: 200px" />.
  </p>
  <p>
    Over time, the
    <input type="text" name="q2" placeholder="2" style="width: 200px" /> sector
    has increasingly taken responsibility for street trees due to the
    privatization of communal spaces.
  </p>
  <p>
    Materials like asphalt and concrete contribute to the urban heat island
    phenomenon by absorbing and retaining solar
    <input type="text" name="q3" placeholder="3" style="width: 200px" />.
  </p>
  <p>
    By improving drainage and filtering pollutants, street trees significantly
    enhance
    <input type="text" name="q4" placeholder="4" style="width: 200px" /> quality
    and mitigate flooding.
  </p>
  <p>
    These trees provide shade, reducing the reliance on artificial
    <input type="text" name="q5" placeholder="5" style="width: 200px" /> systems
    during warmer months.
  </p>
  <p>
    Acting as a protective
    <input type="text" name="q6" placeholder="6" style="width: 200px" /> between
    pedestrians and moving vehicles, street trees reduce noise and offer a sense
    of safety.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ensuring street trees thrive involves choosing appropriate locations,
    providing high-grade
    <input type="text" name="q7" placeholder="7" style="width: 200px" />, and
    shielding them from vandalism and adverse weather.

    <i>
      You should spend about 20 minutes on <b>Questions 14-26</b>, which are
      based on Reading Passage 2 below.
    </i>
  </p>

  <h3>TECHNOLOGY IN EDUCATION: PROS AND CONS</h3>

  <ol type="A">
    <li>
      Technology has transformed the way we live, work, communicate and play. It
      is also transforming the way we educate our children. In the past, schools
      were designed to teach children the skills they would need for a future
      that would be very similar to the present. However, now that technology is
      changing so rapidly, it is hard to predict what those skills will be. What
      we do know is that our students will need to be able to think creatively
      to find solutions to problems we can't even imagine yet. In order to
      prepare them for this uncertain future, our schools are increasingly
      turning to technology in the classroom. But is this a good thing?
    </li>
    <li>
      The benefits of using technology in the classroom are many. For example,
      technology allows students to personalise their learning. They can work at
      their own pace, go back to lessons they missed or didn't understand the
      first time, and get extra practice if they need it. Technology also gives
      students access to a wide range of information and resources. They can use
      the Internet to research topics, watch videos, and read books and
      articles. This can help them to learn more about a subject and develop
      their understanding of it. Another benefit of technology is that it can
      help students to develop important skills. For example, using computers
      and other digital devices can help students to improve their typing and
      computer skills. These are skills that will be useful to them in their
      future studies and careers.
    </li>
    <li>
      There are also some potential drawbacks to using technology in the
      classroom. One concern is that students may become too reliant on
      technology. If they are used to having everything they need at their
      fingertips, they may not be able to think for themselves or solve problems
      independently. Another concern is that students may be distracted by
      technology. If they are allowed to use their devices in class, they may be
      tempted to check social media or play games instead of paying attention to
      the lesson. There is also the risk that students may be exposed to
      inappropriate content online. If they are not supervised, they may come
      across material that is not suitable for their age group.
    </li>
    <li>
      There are also concerns about the impact of technology on students' health
      and well-being. Some studies have shown that too much screen time can lead
      to problems such as eye strain, headaches, and difficulty sleeping. There
      is also the risk that students may become isolated from their peers if
      they spend too much time on their devices. They may miss out on important
      social interactions and opportunities to develop their communication
      skills. In addition, there is the question of whether technology is
      actually improving students' learning. Some studies have shown that
      students who use technology in the classroom do not perform any better
      than those who do not. In fact, in some cases, they may even do worse.
      This may be because they are not using the technology effectively, or
      because they are not being taught how to use it properly.
    </li>
    <li>
      Despite these concerns, many schools are embracing technology and are
      finding ways to overcome the challenges it presents. One way they are
      doing this is by using technology to support traditional teaching methods,
      rather than replacing them. For example, teachers can use interactive
      whiteboards to display information and engage students in lessons. They
      can also use online resources to supplement their teaching and provide
      students with additional practice. Another way schools are overcoming the
      challenges of technology is by setting clear guidelines for its use. For
      example, they may have rules about when and how devices can be used in the
      classroom. They may also have policies in place to protect students from
      inappropriate content online.
    </li>
    <li>
      In order to maximise the benefits of technology in the classroom, it is
      important for teachers to have the right skills and knowledge. They need
      to be able to use technology effectively and to integrate it into their
      teaching in a way that enhances students' learning. This means that
      teachers need to have access to training and professional development
      opportunities. They also need to be supported by their schools and given
      the resources they need to use technology effectively. In addition,
      schools need to have the right infrastructure in place to support the use
      of technology. This includes having reliable Internet access and the right
      hardware and software.
    </li>
    <li>
      In conclusion, technology has the potential to transform education and to
      improve students' learning. However, it is important to recognise that it
      is not a magic solution to all of the challenges facing education today.
      In order to make the most of technology in the classroom, it is important
      to use it effectively and to integrate it into teaching in a way that
      supports students' learning. This means that teachers need to have the
      right skills and knowledge, and schools need to have the right
      infrastructure and support in place.

      You should spend about 20 minutes on <b>Questions 27-40</b>, which are
      based on Reading Passage 3 below.
    </i>
  </p>

  <h3>THE POWER OF THE PLACEBO EFFECT</h3>
  <ol type="A">
    <li>
      The placebo effect is a well-documented phenomenon in which patients feel
      better after receiving a treatment that, in fact, has no active
      properties. In clinical trials, some patients are given experimental
      drugs, while others receive a placebo, often in the form of a sugar pill.
      The placebo effect is the term given to the fact that people often
      perceive an improvement in their condition, even though they are not
      actually receiving any medication with active ingredients.
    </li>
    <li>
      The placebo effect has long been a target of scorn. The term ‘placebo’ was
      originally coined in the 13th century, when it was used to refer to hired
      mourners at a funeral. These ‘mourners’ were not performing a service for
      the deceased, but rather for the people who had paid them. Similarly, a
      placebo is a treatment that is not administered for the benefit of the
      patient, but rather for the benefit of the physician, who can tell the
      patient that he or she has received a treatment. In the 19th century, the
      term ‘placebo’ was used by physicians to refer to treatments that they
      believed were biologically inert, but which they administered anyway in
      order to please the patient.
    </li>
    <li>
      In the 20th century, placebos became widely used as controls in scientific
      studies. In such studies, the experimental group receives the treatment
      being tested, while the control group receives a placebo. The placebo
      effect is then calculated by subtracting the effect of the placebo from
      the effect of the experimental treatment. The placebo effect is considered
      to be a nuisance variable, which must be controlled in order to get an
      accurate measure of the experimental treatment’s effectiveness. This is
      the way that the placebo effect has been viewed for most of the 20th
      century.
    </li>
    <li>
      However, in the 1990s, a few medical researchers began to suggest that the
      placebo effect might be worthy of scientific investigation in its own
      right. One of the first studies to draw attention to the placebo effect
      was published in 1955 by H. K. Beecher, who was a prominent
      anaesthesiologist at Harvard Medical School. Beecher’s study, entitled
      ‘The Powerful Placebo’, did not present any new experimental findings, but
      rather was a review of 15 clinical trials in which both placebo and
      experimental treatments were given. Beecher found that across these
      studies, 35% of the patients were satisfactorily relieved of their
      symptoms by a placebo alone. Beecher concluded that placebos could have a
      powerful effect on a range of conditions, including angina pectoris, the
      common cold, and seasickness.
    </li>
    <li>
      Beecher argued that the placebo effect is not just a result of patients
      believing in the treatment they are receiving, but also of the patient’s
      relationship with the physician. He pointed out that the physician’s
      attitude toward the treatment, the physician’s confidence in the
      treatment, and the physician’s enthusiasm for the treatment can all have
      an impact on the patient’s response to the treatment. The placebo effect
      has been shown to be particularly effective in the treatment of pain. In
      one study, patients with post-operative pain were given either a placebo
      or a painkiller. The patients who received the placebo reported a
      significant reduction in pain, and some even reported complete pain
      relief.
    </li>
    <li>
      In another study, patients with irritable bowel syndrome were given either
      a placebo or no treatment at all. The patients who received the placebo
      reported a significant improvement in their symptoms, while those who
      received no treatment reported no improvement. The placebo effect has even
      been shown to have an impact on surgical outcomes. In one study, patients
      with osteoarthritis of the knee were randomly assigned to receive either
      arthroscopic surgery or a placebo surgery. In the placebo surgery, the
      patients were given an anaesthetic and incisions were made in their knees,
      but no actual surgery was performed. The patients who received the placebo
      surgery reported a significant improvement in their symptoms, and this
      improvement was comparable to the improvement reported by the patients who
      received the actual surgery.
    </li>
    <li>
      The placebo effect is a complex phenomenon that is not fully understood.
      However, it is clear that the placebo effect is a real and powerful
      phenomenon that can have a significant impact on a range of conditions.
      The placebo effect is not just a result of patients believing in the
      treatment they are receiving, but also of the patient’s relationship with
      the physician. The placebo effect is a real, measurable, and powerful
      phenomenon that should be taken seriously by the medical community.
