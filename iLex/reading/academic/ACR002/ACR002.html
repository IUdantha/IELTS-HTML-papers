  <h2>VOYAGE OF GOING: BEYOND THE BLUE LINE 2</h2>

  <p>
    <b>A.</b> One feels a certain sympathy for Captain James Cook on the day in
    1778 that he “discovered” Hawaii. Then on his third expedition to the
    Pacific, the British navigator had explored scores of islands across the
    breadth of the sea, from lush New Zealand to the lonely wastes of Easter
    Island This latest voyage had taken him thousands of miles north from the
    Society Islands to an archipelago so remote that even the ok! Polynesians
    back on Tahiti knew nothing about it. Imagine Cook’s surprise, then, when
    the natives of Hawaii came paddling out in their canoes and greeted him in a
    familiar tongue, one he had heard on virtually every mote of inhabited land
    he had visited Marveling at the ubiquity of this Pacific language and
    culture, he later wondered in his journal: “How shall we account for this
    Nation spreading it self so far over this Vast ocean?”
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>B.</b> Answers have been slow in coming. But now a startling
    archaeological find on the island of Efate, in the Pacific nation of
    Vanuatu, has revealed an ancient seafaring people, the distant ancestors of
    today’s Polynesians, taking their first steps into the unknown. The
    discoveries there have also opened a window into the shadowy work! of those
    early voyagers. At the same time, other pieces of this human puzzle are
    turning up in unlikely places. Climate data gleaned from slow-growing corals
    around the Pacific and from sediments in alpine lakes in South America may
    help explain how, more than a thousand years later, a second wave of
    seafarers beat their way across the entire Pacific.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>C.</b> What we have is a first-or second-generation site containing the
    graves of some of the Pacific’s first explorers,” says Spriggs, professor of
    archaeology at the Australian National University and co-leader of an
    international team excavating the site. It came to light only by luck A
    backhoe operator, digging up topsoil on the grounds of a derelict coconut
    plantation, scraped open a grave— the first of dozens in a burial ground
    some 3,000 years old It is the oldest cemetery ever found in the Pacific
    islands, and it harbors the bones of an ancient people archaeologists call
    the Lapita, a label that derives from a beach in New Caledonia where a
    landmark cache of their pottery was found in the 1950s. They were daring
    blue-water adventurers who roved the sea not just as expbrers but also as
    pioneers, bringing abng everything they would need to build new lives— their
    families and livestock, taro seedlings and stone tools.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>D.</b> Within the span of a few centuries the Lapita stretched the
    boundaries of their world from the jungle-clad vokanoes of Papua New Guinea
    to the bneliest coral outliers of Tonga, at feast 2,000 miles eastward in
    the Pacific. Abng the way they expbred millions of square miles of unknown
    sea, discovering and cobnizing scores of tropical islands never before seen
    by human eyes: Vanuatu, New Caledonia, Fiji, Samoa.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>E.</b> What little is known or surmised about them has been pieced
    together from fragments of pottery, animal bones, obsidian flakes, and such
    oblique sources as comparative linguistics and geochemistry. Although their
    voyages can be traced back to the northern islands of Papua New Guinea,
    their language variants of which are still spoken across the Pacific came
    from Taiwan. And their peculiar style of pottery decoration, created by
    pressing a carved stamp into the clay, probably had its roots in the
    northern Philippines. With the discovery of the Lapita cemetery on Efate,
    the volume of data available to researchers has expanded dramatically. The
    bones of at feast 62 individuals have been uncovered so far including old
    men, young women, even babies—and more skeletons are known to be in the
    ground Archaeobgists were also thrilled to discover six complete Lapita
    pots. It’s an important find, Spriggs says, for it conclusively identifies
    the remains as Lapita. “It would be hard for anyone to argue that these
    aren’t Lapita when you have human bones enshrined inside what is
    unmistakably a Lapita urn.”
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>F.</b> Several lines of evidence also undergird Spriggs’s conclusion that
    this was a community of pioneers making their first voyages into the remote
    reaches of Oceania. For one thing, the radiocarbon dating of bones and
    charcoal places them early in the Lapita expansion. For another, the
    chemical makeup of the obsidian flakes littering the site indicates that the
    rock wasn’t local; instead it was imported from a large island in Papua New
    Guinea’s Bismarck Archipelago, the springboard for the Lapita’s thrust into
    the Pacific. A particularly intriguing clue comes from chemical tests on the
    teeth of several skeletons. DNA teased from these ancient bones may also
    help answer one of the most puzzling questions in Pacific anthropobgy: Did
    all Pacific islanders spring from one source or many? Was there only one
    outward migration from a single point in Asia, or several from different
    points? “This represents the best opportunity we’ve had yet,” says Spriggs,
    “to find out who the Lapita actually were, where they came from, and who
    their cbsest descendants are today.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>G.</b> “There is one stubborn question for which archaeobgy has yet to
    provide any answers: How did the Lapita accomplish the ancient equivalent of
    a moon landing, many times over? No one has found one of their canoes or any
    rigging, which could reveal how the canoes were sailed Nor do the oral
    histories and traditions of later Polynesians offer any insights, for they
    segue into myth long before they reach as far back in time as the Lapita.”
    All we can say for certain is that the Lapita had canoes that were capable
    of ocean voyages, and they had the ability to sail them,” says Geoff Irwin,
    a professor of archaeology at the University of Auckland and an avid
    yachtsman. Those sailing skills, he says, were developed and passed down
    over thousands of years by earlier mariners who worked their way through the
    archipelagoes of the western Pacific making short crossings to islands
    within sight of each other. Reaching Fiji, as they did a century or so
    later, meant crossing more than 500 miles of ocean, pressing on day after
    day into the great blue void of the Pacific. What gave them the courage to
    launch out on such a risky voyage?
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>H.</b> The Lapita’s thrust into the Pacific was eastward, against the
    prevailing trade winds, Irwin notes. Those nagging headwinds, he argues, may
    have been the key to their success. “They could sail out for days into the
    unknown and reconnoiter, secure in the knowledge that if they didn’t find
    anything, they could turn about and catch a swift ride home on the trade
    winds. It’s what made the whole thing work.” Once out there, skilled
    seafarers would detect abundant leads to follow to land: seabirds and
    turtles, coconuts and twigs carried out to sea by the tides, and the
    afternoon pileup of clouds on the horizon that often betokens an island in
    the distance. Some islands may have broadcast their presence with far less
    subtlety than a cloud bank. Some of the most violent eruptions anywhere on
    the planet during the past 10,000 years occurred in Melanesia, which sits
    nervously in one of the most explosive volcanic regions on Earth. Even less
    spectacular eruptions would have sent plumes of smoke bilbwing into the
    stratosphere and rained ash for hundreds of miles. It’s possible that the
    Lapita saw these signs of distant islands and later sailed off in their
    direction, knowing they would find land For returning explorers, successful
    or not, the geography of their own archipelagoes provided a safety net to
    keep them from overshooting their home ports and sailing off into eternity.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>I.</b> However they did it, the Lapita spread themselves a third of the
    way across the Pacific, then called it quits for reasons known only to them.
    Ahead lay the vast emptiness of the central Pacific, and perhaps they were
    too thinly stretched to venture farther. They probably never numbered more
    than a few thousand in total, and in their rapid migration eastward they
    encountered hundreds of islands more than 300 in Fiji alone. Still, more
    than a millennium would pass before the Lapita’s descendants, a people we
    now call the Polynesians, struck out in search of new territory.

  <h2>HAVE TEENAGERS ALWAYS EXISTED</h2>

  <p>
    Our ancestor, Homo erectus, may not have had culture or even language, but
    did they have teenagers? That question has been contested in the past few
    years, with some anthropologists claiming evidence of an adolescent phase in
    human fossil. This is not merely an academic debate. Humans today are the
    only animals on Earth to have a teenage phase, yet we have very little idea
    why. Establishing exactly when adolescence first evolved and finding out
    what sorts of changes in our bodies and lifestyles it was associated with
    could help us understand its purpose. Why do we, uniquely, have a growth
    spurt so late in life?
  </p>

  <p>
    Until recently, the dominant explanation was that physical growth is delayed
    by our need to grow large brains and to learn all the behaviour patterns
    associated with humanity – speaking, social interaction and so on. While
    such behaviour is still developing, humans cannot easily fend for
    themselves, so it is best to stay small and look youthful. That way your
    parents and other members of the social group are motivated to continue
    looking after you. What’s more, studies of mammals show a strong
    relationship between brain size and the rate of development, with
    larger-brained animals taking longer to reach adulthood. Humans are at the
    far end of this spectrum. If this theory is correct, and the development of
    large brains accounts for the teenage growth spurt, the origin of
    adolescence should have been with the evolution of our own species (Homo
    sapiens) and Neanderthals, starting almost 200,000 years ago. The trouble
    is, some of the fossil evidence seems to tell a different story.
  </p>

  <p>
    The human fossil record is extremely sparse, and the number of fossilised
    children minuscule. Nevertheless, in the past few years anthropologists have
    begun to look at what can be learned of the lives of our ancestors from
    these youngsters. One of the most studied is the famous Turkana boy, an
    almost complete skeleton of Homo erectus from 1.6 million years ago found in
    Kenya in 1984. Accurately assessing how old someone is from their skeleton
    is a tricky business. Even with a modern human, you can only make a rough
    estimate based on the developmental stage of teeth and bones and the
    skeleton’s general size.
  </p>

  <p>
    You need as many developmental markers as possible to get an estimate of
    age. The Turkana boy’s teeth made him 10 or 11 years old. The features of
    his skeleton put him at 13, but he was as tall as a modern 15-year-old.
    Susan Anton of New York University points to research by Margaret Clegg who
    studied a collection of 18th- and 19th-century skeletons whose ages at death
    were known. When she tried to age the skeletons without checking the
    records, she found similar discrepancies to those of the Turkana boy. One
    10-year-old boy, for example, had a dental age of 9, the skeleton of a
    6-year-old but was tall enough to be 11. The Turkana kid still has a rounded
    skull, and needs more growth to reach the adult shape,’ Anton adds. She
    thinks that Homo erectus had already developed modern human patterns of
    growth, with a late, if not quite so extreme, adolescent spurt. She believes
    Turkana boy was just about to enter it.
  </p>

  <p>
    If Anton is right, that theory contradicts the orthodox idea linking late
    growth with development of a large brain. Anthropologist Steven Leigh from
    the University of Illinois goes further. He believes the idea of adolescence
    as catch-up growth does not explain why the growth rate increases so
    dramatically. He says that many apes have growth spurts in particular body
    regions that are associated with reaching maturity, and this makes sense
    because by timing the short but crucial spells of maturation to coincide
    with the seasons when food is plentiful, they minimise the risk of being
    without adequate food supplies while growing. What makes humans unique is
    that the whole skeleton is involved. For Leigh, this is the key.
  </p>

  <p>
    According to his theory, adolescence evolved as an integral part of
    efficient upright locomotion, as well as to accommodate more complex brains.
    Fossil evidence suggests that our ancestors first walked on two legs six
    million years ago. If proficient walking was important for survival, perhaps
    the teenage growth spurt has very ancient origins. While many
    anthropologists will consider Leigh’s theory a step too far, he is not the
    only one with new ideas about the evolution of teenagers.
  </p>

  <p>
    Another approach, which has produced a surprising result, relies on the
    minute analysis of tooth growth. Every nine days or so the growing teeth of
    both apes and humans acquire ridges on their enamel surface. These are like
    rings in a tree trunk: the number of them tells you how long the crown of a
    tooth took to form. Across mammals, the rate at which teeth develop is
    closely related to how fast the brain grows and the age you mature. Teeth
    are good indicators of life history because their growth is less related to
    the environment and nutrition than is the growth of the skeleton.
  </p>

  <p>
    A more decisive piece of evidence came last year, when researchers in France
    and Spain published their findings from a study of Neanderthal teeth.
    Neanderthals had much faster tooth growth than Homo erectus who went before
    them, and hence, possibly, a shorter childhood. Lead researcher Fernando
    Ramirez-Rozzi thinks Neanderthals died young – about 25 years old —
    primarily because of the cold, harsh environment they had to endure in
    glacial Europe. They evolved to grow up quicker than their immediate
    ancestors. Neanderthals and Homo erectus probably had to reach adulthood
    fairly quickly, without delaying for an adolescent growth spurt. So it still
    looks as though we are the original teenagers.

      You should spend about 20 minutes on <b>Questions 28-40</b>, which are
      based on Reading Passage 3 below.
    </i>
  </p>

  <h2>WATER FILTER</h2>

  <p>
    <b>A.</b> An ingenious invention is set to bring clean water to the third
    world, and while the science may be cutting edge, the materials are
    extremely down to earth. A handful of clay yesterday’s coffee grounds and
    some cow manure are the ingredients that could bring clean, safe drinking
    water to much of the third world.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>B.</b> The simple new technology, developed by ANU materials scientist
    Mr. Tony Flynn, allows water filters to be made from commonly available
    materials and fired on the ground using cow manure as the source of heat,
    without the need for a kiln. The filters have been tested and shown to
    remove common pathogens (disease-producing organisms) including E-coli.
    Unlike other water filtering devices, the filters are simple and inexpensive
    to make. “They are very simple to explain and demonstrate and can be made by
    anyone, anywhere,” says Mr. Flynn. “They don’t require any western
    technology. All you need is terracotta clay, a compliant cow and a match.”
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>C.</b> The production of the filters is extremely simple. Take a handful
    of dry, crushed clay, mix it with a handful of organic material, such as
    used tea leaves, coffee grounds or rice hulls, add enough water to make a
    stiff biscuit-like mixture and form a cylindrical pot that has one end
    closed, then dry it in the sun. According to Mr. Flynn, used coffee grounds
    have given the best results to date. Next, surround the pots with straw; put
    them in a mound of cow manure, light the straw and then top up the burning
    manure as required. In less than 60 minutes the filters are finished. The
    walls of the finished pot should be about as thick as an adult’s index. The
    properties of cow manure are vital as the fuel can reach a temperature of
    700 degrees in half an hour and will be up to 950 degrees after another 20
    to 30 minutes. The manure makes a good fuel because it is very high in
    organic material that burns readily and quickly; the manure has to be dry
    and is best used exactly as found in the field, there is no need to break it
    up or process it any further.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>D.</b> “A potter’s kiln is an expensive item and can could take up to
    four or five hours to get up to 800 degrees. It needs expensive or scarce
    fuel, such as gas or wood to heat it and experience to run it. With no
    technology, no insulation and nothing other than a pile of cow manure and a
    match, none of these restrictions apply,” Mr. Flynn says.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>E.</b> It is also helpful that, like terracotta clay and organic
    material, cow dung is freely available across the developing world. “A cow
    is a natural fuel factory. My understanding is that cow dung as a fuel would
    be pretty much the same wherever you would find it.” Just as using manure as
    a fuel for domestic uses is not a new idea, the porosity of clay is
    something that potters have known about for years, and something that as a
    former ceramics lecturer in the ANU School of Art, Mr. Flynn is well aware
    of. The difference is that rather than viewing the porous nature of the
    material as a problem — after all not many people want a pot that won’t hold
    water — his filters capitalize on this property.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>F.</b> Other commercial ceramic filters do exist, but, even if available,
    with prices starting at US$5 each, they are often outside the budgets of
    most people in the developing world. The filtration process is simple, but
    effective. The basic principle is that there are passages through the filter
    that are wide enough for water droplets to pass through, but too narrow for
    pathogens. Tests with the deadly E-coli bacterium have seen the filters
    remove 96.4 to 99.8 per cent of the pathogen — well within safe levels.
    Using only one filter it takes two hours to filter a litre of water. The use
    of organic material, which burns away after firing, helps produce the
    structure in which pathogens will become trapped. It overcomes the potential
    problems of finer clays that may not let water through and also means that
    cracks are soon halted. And like clay and cow dung, it is universally
    available.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>G.</b> The invention was born out of a World Vision project involving the
    Manatuto community in East Timor. The charity wanted to help set up a small
    industry manufacturing water filters, but initial research found the local
    clay to be too fine — a problem solved by the addition of organic material.
    While the AF problems of producing a working ceramic filter in East Timor
    were overcome, the solution was kiln-based and particular to that
    community’s materials and couldn’t be applied elsewhere. Manure firing, with
    no requirement for a kiln, has made this zero technology approach available
    anywhere it is needed. With all the components being widely available, Mr.
    Flynn says there is no reason the technology couldn’t be applied throughout
    the developing world, and with no plans to patent his idea, there will be no
    legal obstacles to it being adopted in any community that needs it.
    “Everyone has a right to clean water, these filters have the potential to
    enable anyone in the world to drink water safely,” says Mr. Flynn.
