  <h2>Design the mat and Foot health</h2>
  <p>
    <b>A</b><br />
    Indoor types will appreciate the cobblestone walkway, a knobbly textured
    plastic mat that they can wobble along in the comfort of their own homes.
    And for the more adventurous, there are shoes designed to throw you off
    balance.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>B</b><br />
    The technology may be cutting edge, but its origins are deep and exotic.
    Research into the idea that flat floors could be detrimental to our health
    was pioneered back in the late 1960s. While others in Long Beach,
    California, contemplated peace and love, podiatrist Charles Brantingham and
    physiologist Bruce Beekman were concerned with more pedestrian matters. They
    reckoned that the growing epidemic of high blood pressure, varicose veins
    and deep-vein thromboses might be linked to the uniformity of the surfaces
    that we tend to stand and walk on.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>C</b><br />
    The trouble, as they saw it, was that walking continuously on flat floors,
    sidewalks and streets concentrate forces on just a few areas of the foot. As
    a result, these surfaces are likely to be far more conducive to chronic
    stress syndromes than natural ones, where the foot meets the ground in a
    wide variety of orientations. The anatomy of the foot parallels that of the
    human hand – each having 26 bones, 33 joints and more than 100 muscles,
    tendons and ligaments. Modem lifestyles waste all this flexibility in your
    socks. Brantingham and Beekman became convinced that damage was being done
    simply by people standing on even surfaces and that this could be rectified
    by introducing a wobble.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>D</b><br />
    “In Beijing and Shanghai city dwellers take daily walks on cobbled paths to
    improve their health.” To test their ideas, they got 65 clerks and factory
    workers to try standing on a variable terrain floor – spongy mats with
    amounts of giving across the surface. This modest irregularity allowed the
    soles of the volunteers’ feet to deviate slightly from the horizontal each
    time they shifted position. As the researchers hoped, this simple
    intervention turned out to make a huge difference over just a few weeks.
    Just a slight wobble from the floor activated a host of muscles in people’s
    legs, which in turn helped to pump blood back to their hearts. The muscle
    action prevented the pooling of blood in their feet and legs, reducing the
    stress on the entire cardiovascular system. And two-thirds of the volunteers
    reported feeling much less tired. Yet decades later, the flooring of the
    world’s workplaces remains relentlessly smooth.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>E</b><br />
    Earlier this year, however, the idea was given a new lease of life when
    researchers in Oregon announced findings from a similar experiment with
    people over 60. John Fisher and colleagues at the Oregon Research Institute
    in Eugene designed a mat intended to replicate the effect of walking on
    cobblestones. In tests funded by the National Institute of Aging, they got
    some 50 adults to walk on the mats in their stockinged feet for less than an
    hour three times a week. After 16 weeks, these people showed marked
    improvements in balance and mobility, and even a significant reduction in
    blood pressure. People in a control group who walked on ordinary floors also
    improved but not as dramatically.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>F</b><br />
    The mats are now on sale at $35. “Our first 1000 cobblestone mats sold in
    three weeks,” Fisher says. Production is now being scaled up. Even so,
    demand could exceed supply if this foot-stimulating activity really is a
    “useful non-pharmacological approach for preventing or controlling
    hypertension of older adults”, as the researchers believe. They are not
    alone in extolling the revitalizing powers of cobblestones. Reflexologists
    have long advocated walking on textured surfaces to stimulate so-called
    “acupoints” on the soles of the feet. Practitioners of this unorthodox
    therapy believe that pressure applied to particular spots on the foot
    connects directly to corresponding organs and somehow enhances their
    function. In China, spas, hotels, apartment blocks and even factories
    promote their cobblestone paths as healthful amenities. Fisher admits he got
    the idea from regular visits to the country. In Beijing and Shanghai city
    dwellers take daily walks along cobbled paths to improve their health. “In
    the big cities, people take off their shoes and walk on these paths for 5 or
    10 minutes, perhaps several times a day,” Fisher says.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>G</b><br />
    The idea is now taking off in Europe too. People in Germany, Austria and
    Switzerland can visit “barefoot parks” and walk along “paths of the senses”
    – with mud, logs, stone and moss underfoot – to receive what’s known there
    as reflexzon-massage. And it is not difficult to construct your own “health
    pathway”. American reflexologists Barbara and Kevin Kunz, based in
    Albuquerque, New Mexico, advise that you cobble together a walkway using
    broom handles, bamboo poles, hosepipes, gravel, pebbles, dried peas,
    driftwood, fallen logs, sand, door mats and strips of turf.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>H</b><br />
    If your enthusiasm for DIY doesn’t stretch to this, and Fisher’s cobblestone
    mats are all sold out, there is another option. A new shoe on the market
    claims to transform flat, hard, artificial surfaces into something like
    natural uneven ground. “These shoes have an unbelievable effect,” says Benno
    Nigg, an exercise scientist at the human performance laboratory of Calgary
    University in Canada, which has done contract research for the shoe’s
    manufacturers. “They are one of the best things to have happened to
    humankind for years.” Known as Masai Barefoot Technology, or MBTs, the shoes
    have rounded soles that cause you to rock slightly when you stand still,
    exercising the small muscles around the ankle that are responsible for
    fore-aft stability. Forces in the joint are reduced, putting less strain on
    the system, Nigg claims.

    You should spend about 20 .minutes on Questions 14-26, which are based on
    Reading Passage 2 below.
  </p>

  <h2>Brunel: ‘The Practical Prophet’</h2>
  <p>
    <b>A</b><br />
    In the frontispiece of his book on Brunel, Peter Hay quotes from Nicholson’s
    British Encyclopaedia of 1909 as follows: ‘Engineers are extremely necessary
    for these purposes; wherefore it is requisite that, besides being ingenious,
    they should be brave in proportion.’ His father, Sir Marc Isambard Brunel
    (1769-1849), was himself a famous engineer, of French parents. He eventually
    settled in Britain and married the Sophia Kingdom, an English woman whom he
    had known in France in earlier days. Their only son Isambard was born on 9
    April 1806. He was sent to France at the age of 14 to study mathematics and
    science and was 16 when he returned to England to work with his father. Sir
    Marc was then building his famous tunnel under the River Thames. Isambard
    was recuperating near Bristol from injuries received in a tunnel cave-in
    when he became involved with his own first major project. –The Suspension
    Bridge ion the Avon Gorge
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>B</b><br />
    The span of Brunel’s bridge was over 700ft, longer than any existing when it
    was designed, and the height above water about 245ft. The technical
    challenges of this engineering project were immense, and Brunel dealt with
    them with his usual, thoroughness and ingenuity. Two design competitions
    were held, and the great bridge designer Thomas Telford was the committee’s
    expert. Brunel presented four designs. He went beyond technicalities to
    include arguments based on, among other things, the grace of his tower
    design. Unfortunately, he only got so far as to put up the end piers in his
    lifetime. The Clifton Suspension Bridge was completed in his honor by his
    engineering friends in1864 and is still in use. The Great Western Railway
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>C</b><br />
    While Brunel was still in Bristol, and with the Avon Bridge project stopped
    or going slowly, he became aware that the civic authorities saw the need for
    a railway link to London. Railway location was controversial since private
    landowners and towns had to be dealt with. Mainly, the landed gentry did not
    want a messy, noisy railway anywhere near them. The Duke of Wellington (of
    Waterloo fame) was certainly against it. Again Brunel showed great skill in
    presenting his arguments to the various committees and individuals. BruneI
    built his railway with a broad gauge (7ft) instead of the standard 4ft 8½in,
    which had been used for lines already installed. There is no doubt that the
    broad gauge gave superior ride and stability, but it was fighting a
    standard. Atmospheric railway:
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>D</b><br />
    Brunel’s ready acceptance of new ideas overpowered good engineering judgment
    (at least in hindsight) when he advocated the installation of an atmospheric
    railway in South Devon. It had the great attraction of doing away with the
    locomotive and potentially could deal with steeper gradients. Since this
    connecting arm had to run along the slit, it had to be opened through a flap
    as the train progressed, but closed airtight behind it. Materials were not
    up to it, and this arrangement was troublesome and expensive to keep in
    repair. After a year of frustration, the system was abandoned. Brunel
    admitted his failure and took responsibility. He also took no fee for his
    work, setting a good professional example. Brunel’s ships:
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>E</b><br />
    The idea of using steam to power ships to cross the ocean appealed to
    Brunel. When his GWR company directors complained about the great length of
    their railway (it was only about 100 miles), Isambard jokingly suggested
    that they could even make it longer—why not go all the way to New York and
    call the link the Great Western. The “Great Western” was the first steamship
    to engage in transatlantic service. Brunel formed the Great Western
    Steamship Company and construction started on the ship in Bristol in 1836.
    Built of wood and 236ft long, the Great Western was launched in 1837 and
    powered by sail and paddlewheels. The first trip to New York took just 15
    days, and 14 days to return. This was a great success, a one way trip under
    sail would take more than a month. The Great Western was the firsts
    steamship to engage in transatlantic service and made 74 crossings to New
    York.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>F</b><br />
    Having done so well with the Great Western, Brunel immediately got to work
    on an even bigger ship. Great Britain was made of iron and also built-in
    Bristol, 322ft in length. The initial design was for the ship to be driven
    by paddle wheels, but Brunel had seen one of the first propeller-driven
    ships to arrive in Britain, and he abandoned his plans for paddlewheel
    propulsion. The ship was launched in 1843 and was the first screw-driven
    iron ship to cross the Atlantic. Great Britain ran aground early in its
    career but was repaired, sold, and sailed for years to Australia, and other
    parts of the world, setting the standard for ocean travel. In the early
    1970s, the old ship was rescued from the Falklands and is now under
    restoration in Bristol.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>G</b><br />
    Conventional wisdom in Brunel’s day was that steamships could not carry
    enough coal to make long ocean voyages. But he correctly figured out that
    this was a case where size mattered. He set out to design the biggest ship
    ever, five times larger than any ship built up to that time. Big enough to
    carry fuel to get to Australia without refueling, in addition, it would
    carry 4,000 passengers.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Great Eastern was 692ft long, with a displacement of about 32,000 tons.
    Construction began in 1854 on the Thames at Millwall. Brunel had chosen John
    Scott Russell to build the ship. He was a well-established engineer and
    naval architect, but the contract did not go well. Among other things, Scott
    Russell was very low in his estimates and money was soon a problem.
    Construction came to a standstill in 1856 and Brunel himself had to take
    over the work. But Brunel was nothing if not determined and by September
    1859, after a delayed and problem -ridden launch, the Great Eastern was
    ready for the maiden voyage, Brunei was too sick to go, but it was just as
    well because only a few hours out there was an explosion in the engine room
    which would have destroyed a lesser ship. Brunel died within a week or so of
    the accident. The great ship never carried 4,000 passengers (among other
    things, the Suez Canal came along) and although it made several
    transatlantic crossings, it was not a financial success. Shortly after the
    Great Eastern began working life, the American entrepreneur Cyrus Field and
    his backers were looking for a ship big enough to carry 5,000 tons of
    telegraphic cable, which was to be laid on the ocean floor from Ireland to
    Newfoundland. Although Brunel did not have it in mind, the Great Eastern was
    an excellent vessel for this work on July 27, 1866. It successfully
    completed the connection and a hundred years of transatlantic communication
    by cable began. The ship continued this career for several years, used for
    laying cables in many parts of the world.

    You should spend about 20 minutes on <b>Questions 27-40</b>, which are based
    on Reading Passage 3 below.
  </p>
  <h2>Movie of Metropolis</h2>
  <p>…being the science-fiction film that is steadily becoming a fact</p>
  <p>
    <b>A</b><br />
    When German director Fritz Lang visited the United States in 1924, his first
    glimpse of the country was a night-time view of the New York skyline from
    the deck of an ocean liner. This, he later recalled, was the direct
    inspiration for what is still probably the most innovative and influential
    science-fiction film ever made – Metropolis.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>B</b><br />
    Metropolis is a bleak vision of the early twenty-first century that is at
    once both chilling and exhilarating. This spectacular city of the future is
    a technological marvel of high-rise buildings connected by elevated railways
    and airships. It’s also a world of extreme inequality and social division.
    The workers live below ground and exist as machines working in an endless
    routine of mind-numbing 10-hour shifts while the city’s elite lead lives of
    luxury high above. Presiding over them all is the Master of Metropolis, John
    Fredersen, whose sole satisfaction seems to lie in the exercise of power.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>C</b><br />
    Lang’s graphic depiction of the future is conceived in almost totally
    abstract terms. The function of the individual machines is never defined.
    Instead, this mass of dials, levers and gauges symbolically stands for all
    machines and all industry, with the workers as slave-live extensions of the
    equipment they have to operate. Lang emphasizes this idea in the famous
    shift-change sequence at the start of the movie when the workers walk in
    zombie-like geometric ranks, all dressed in the same dark overalls and all
    exhibiting the same bowed head and dead-eyed stare. An extraordinary fantasy
    sequence sees one machine transformed into a huge open-jawed statue which
    then literally swallows them up.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>D</b><br />
    On one level the machines and the exploited workers simply provide the
    wealth and services which allow the elite to live their lives of leisure,
    but on a more profound level, the purpose of all this demented industry is
    to serve itself. Power, control and the continuance of the system from one
    10-hour shift to the next is all that counts. The city consumes people and
    their labour and in the process becomes a perverse parody of a living being.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>E</b><br />It is enlightening, I think, to relate the film to the modern
    global economy in which multinational corporations now routinely close their
    factories in one continent so that they can take advantage of cheap labour
    in another. Like the industry in Metropolis, these corporations’ goals of
    increased efficiency and profits have little to do with the welfare of the
    majority of their employees or that of the population at large. Instead,
    their aims are to sustain the momentum of their own growth and to increase
    the monetary rewards to a tiny elite – their executives and shareholders.
    Fredersen himself is the essence of the big company boss: Rupert Murdoch
    would probably feel perfectly at home in his huge skyscraper office with its
    panoramic view of the city below. And it is important that there is never
    any mention of government in Metropolis – the whole concept is by
    implication obsolete. The only people who have power are the supreme
    industrialist, Fredersen, and his magician/scientist cohort Rotwang.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>F</b><br />
    So far so good: when the images are allowed to speak for themselves the film
    is impeccable both in its symbolism and in its cynicism. The problem with
    Metropolis is its sentimental story-line, which sees Freder, Fredersen’s
    son, instantly falling in love with the visionary Maria. Maria leads an
    underground pseudo-religious movement and preaches that the workers should
    not rebel but should await the arrival of a ‘Mediator’ between the ‘Head’
    (capital) and the ‘Hands’ (labour). That mediator is the ‘Heart’ – love, as
    embodied, finally, by Freder’s love of Maria and his father’s love of him.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>G</b><br />Lang wrote the screenplay in collaboration with his then-wife
    Thea von Harbou. In 1933 he fled from the Nazis (and continued a very
    successful career in Hollywood). She stayed in Germany and continued to make
    films under the Hitler regime. There is a constant tension within the film
    between the too-tidy platitudes of von Harbou’s script and the
    uncompromisingly caustic vigour of Lang’s imagery.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>H</b><br />
    To my mind, both in Metropolis and in the real world, it’s not so much that
    the ‘Head’ and ‘Hands’ require a ‘Heart’ to mediate between them but that
    the ‘Hands’ need to develop their own ‘Head’, their own political
    consciousness, and act accordingly – through the ballot box, through buying
    power and through a sceptical resistance to the materialistic fantasies of
    the Fredersens.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>I</b><br />
    All the same, Metropolis is probably more accurate now as a representation
    of industrial and social relations than it has been at any time since its
    original release. And Fredersen is certainly still the most potent movie
    symbol of the handful of elusive corporate figureheads who increasingly
    treat the world as a Metropolis-like global village.

  <p>
    The director depicts a world of inequality and
    <input type="text" name="q31" style="width: 200px" placeholder="31" />. In
    the future, the mindless masses of workers living underground are treated as
    <input type="text" name="q32" style="width: 200px" placeholder="32" />. And
    the master of them is
    <input type="text" name="q33" style="width: 200px" placeholder="33" />, who
    is in charge of the whole city. The writer claims that the director, Fritz
    Lang, presents the movie in an
    <input type="text" name="q34" style="width: 200px" placeholder="34" /> term,
    where the
    <input type="text" name="q35" style="width: 200px" placeholder="35" /> of
    the individual machines is not defined. Besides, the writer compares the
    film to the modern global economy in which multinational corporations
    concern more about the growing
    <input type="text" name="q36" style="width: 200px" placeholder="36" /> and
    money.
