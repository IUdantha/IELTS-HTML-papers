  <h3>Spot the Difference</h3>

  <p>
    <b>A.</b> Taxonomic history has been made this week, at least according to
    the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). a conservation group. Scientists have
    described a new species of clouded leopard from the tropical forests of
    Indonesia with spots (or “clouds", as they are poetically known; smaller
    than those of other clouded leopards, with fur a little darker and with a
    double as opposed to a "partial double" stripe down its back. <br /><br />
    <b>B. </b>
    However, no previously unknown beast has suddenly leapt out from the forest.
    Instead, some scientists have proposed a change in the official taxonomic
    accounting system of clouded leopards. Where there were four subspecies
    there will likely now be two species. A genetic analysis and a closer
    inspection of museum specimens’ coats published in Current Biology has found
    no relevant difference between three subspecies described 50 years ago from
    continental Asia and from the Hainan and Taiwan islands. The 5,000-11,000
    clouded leopards on Borneo, the 3,000 -7,000 on Sumatra, and the remaining
    few on the nearby Batu islands can now, the authors say, claim a more
    elevated distinction as a species. <br /><br /><b>C. </b> What this actually
    means is fuzzy and whether it is scientifically important is questionable.
    In any case, biologists do not agree what species and subspecies are.
    Creatures are given Latin first and second names (corresponding to a genus
    and species) according to the convention of Carl von Linné, who was born 300
    years ago this May. But Linneaus, as he is more commonly known, thought of
    species as perfectly discrete units created by God. Darwinism has them as
    mutable things, generated gradually over time by natural selection. So,
    delineating when enough variation has evolved to justify a new category is
    largely a matter of taste. <br /><br /><b>D. </b> Take ants and butterflies.
    Ant experts have recently been waging a war against all types of species
    subdivision. Lepidopterists, on the other hand, cling to the double barrel
    second names from their discipline’s 19th-century tradition, and categorise
    many local subclasses within species found over wide areas. Thus, it would
    be futile - if one were so inclined - to attempt to compare the diversity of
    ant and butterfly populations. <br /><br /><b>E. </b> The traditional way
    around the problem is to call a species all members of a group that share
    the same gene pool. They can mate together and produce fertile offspring.
    Whether Indonesian clouded leopards can make cubs with continental ones
    remains unknown but seems probable. Instead, the claim this week is that
    genetics and slight differences in fur patterning are enough to justify
    rebranding the clouded leopard as two significant types. Genetically, that
    makes sense if many DNA variations correlate perfectly between members of
    the two groups. The authors did find some correlation, but they looked for
    it in only three Indonesian animals. A larger sample would have been more
    difficult. <br /><br /><b>F. </b> One thing is abundantly clear:
    conservationists who are trying to stop the destruction of the leopards’
    habitat in Borneo and Sumatra see the announcement of a new species of big
    cat as a means to gain publicity and political capital. Upgrading subspecies
    to species is a strategy which James Mallet, of University College London,
    likes to call species inflation. It is a common by-product of genetic
    analysis, which can reveal differences between populations that the eye
    cannot. Creating ever more detailed genetic categories means creating
    smaller and increasingly restricted populations of more species. The trouble
    is that risks devaluing the importance of the term “species”. <br /><br /><b
      >G.
    </b>
    The problem of redefining species by genetics is the creation of taxonomic
    confusion, a potentially serious difficulty for conservationists and others.
    The recent proposal to add the polar bear to the list of animals protected
    under America’s Endangered Species Act is an example. That seems all well
    and good. However, study the genetics and it transpires that polar bears are
    closer to some brown bears, than some brown bears are to each other. Go by
    the genes and it seems that the polar bear would not count as a species in
    its own right (and thus might not enjoy the protection afforded to species)
    but should be labelled a subspecies of the brown bear.

      You should spend about 20 minutes on <b>Questions 14-26</b>, which are
      based on Reading Passage 2 below.
    </i>
  </p>

  <h3>The Fertility Bust</h3>

  <p>
    <b>A.</b> Falling populations - the despair of state pension systems - are
    often regarded with calmness, even a secret satisfaction, by ordinary
    people. Europeans no longer need large families to gather the harvest or to
    look after parents. They have used their good fortune to have fewer
    children, thinking this will make their lives better. Much of Europe is too
    crowded as it is. Is this all that is going on? Germans have been agonising
    about recent European Union estimates suggesting that 30% of German women
    are, and will remain, childless. The number is a guess: Germany does not
    collect figures like this. Even if the share is 25%, as other surveys
    suggest, it is by far the highest in Europe. <br /><br /><b>B. </b> Germany
    is something of an oddity in this. In most countries with low fertility,
    young women have their first child late, and stop at one. In Germany, women
    with children often have two or three, but many have none at all. Germany is
    also odd in experiencing low fertility for such a long time. Europe is
    demographically polarised. Countries in the north and west saw fertility
    fall early, in the 1960s. Recently, they have seen it stabilise or rise back
    towards replacement level (i.e. 2.1 births per woman). Countries in the
    south and east, on the other hand, saw fertility rates fall much faster,
    more recently (often to below 1.3, a rate at which the population falls by
    half every 45 years). Germany combines both. Its fertility rate fell below 2
    in 1971, However, it has stayed low and is still only just above 1.3. This
    challenges the notion that European fertility is likely to stabilise at
    tolerable levels. It raises questions about whether the low birth rates of
    Italy and Poland, say, really are, as some have argued, merely temporary.
    <br /><br /><b>C. </b> The list of explanations for why German fertility has
    not rebounded is long. Michael Teitelbaum, a demographer at the Sloan
    Foundation in New York ticks them off: poor childcare; unusually extended
    higher education; inflexible labour laws; high youth unemployment; and
    non-economic or cultural factors. One German writer, Gunter Grass, wrote a
    novel, “Headbirths”, in 1982, about Harm and Dorte Peters, “a model couple”
    who disport themselves on the beaches of Asia rather than invest time and
    trouble in bringing up a baby. “They keep a cat,” writes Mr. Grass, “and
    still have no child.” The novel is subtitled “The Germans Are Dying Out”.
    With the exception of this cultural factor, none of these features is
    peculiar to Germany. If social and economic explanations account for
    persistent low fertility there, then they may well produce the same
    persistence elsewhere. <br /><br /><b>D. </b> The reason for hoping
    otherwise is that the initial decline in southern and eastern Europe was
    drastic, and may be reversible. In the Mediterranean, demographic decline
    was associated with freeing young women from the constraints of traditional
    Catholicism, which encouraged large families. In eastern Europe, it was
    associated with the collapse in living standards and the ending of pro-birth
    policies. In both regions, as such temporary factors fade, fertility rates
    might, in principle, be expected to rise. Indeed, they may already be
    stabilising in Italy and Spain. Germany tells you that reversing these
    trends can be hard. There, and elsewhere, fertility rates did not merely
    fall; they went below what people said they wanted. In 1979, Eurobarometer
    asked Europeans how many children they would like. Almost everywhere, the
    answer was two: the traditional two-child ideal persisted even when people
    were not delivering it. This may have reflected old habits of mind. Or
    people may really be having fewer children than they claim to want.
    <br /><br /><b>E. </b> A recent paper suggests how this might come about. If
    women postpone their first child past their mid-30s, it may be too late to
    have a second even if they want one (the average age of first births in most
    of Europe is now 30). If everyone does the same, one child becomes the norm:
    a one-child policy by example rather than coercion, as it were. If women
    wait to start a family until they are established at work, they may end up
    postponing children longer than they might otherwise have chosen. When birth
    rates began to fall in Europe, this was said to be a simple matter of
    choice. That was true, but it is possible that fertility may overshoot below
    what people might naturally have chosen. For many years, politicians have
    argued that southern Europe will catch up from its fertility decline because
    women, having postponed their first child, will quickly have a second and
    third. The overshoot theory suggests there may be only partial recuperation.
    Postponement could permanently lower fertility, not just redistribute it
    across time. <br /><br /><b>F. </b> There is a twist. If people have fewer
    children than they claim to want, how they see the family may change, too.
    Research by Tomas Sobotka of the Vienna Institute of Demography suggests
    that, after decades of low fertility, a quarter of young German men and a
    fifth of young women say they have no intention of having children and think
    that this is fine. When Eurobarometer repeated its poll about ideal family
    size in 2001, support for the two-child model had fallen everywhere. Parts
    of Europe, then, may be entering a new demographic trap. People restrict
    family size from choice. Social, economic, and cultural factors then cause
    this natural fertility decline to overshoot. This changes expectations, to
    which people respond by having even fewer children. That does not
    necessarily mean that birth rates will fall even more: there may yet be some
    natural floor, but it could mean that recovery from very low fertility rates
    proves to be slow or even non-existent.

  <h3>Teens Try to Change the World, One Purchase at a Time</h3>

  <p>
    When classes adjourn here at the Fayerweather Street School, eighth-graders
    ignore the mall down the street and go straight to the place they consider
    much cooler: the local natural-foods grocer’s. There, they gather in groups
    of ten or more sometimes, smitten by a marketing atmosphere that links
    attractiveness to eating well. When time comes to buy something even as
    small as a chocolate treat, they feel good knowing a farmer somewhere
    probably received a good price. “Food is something you need to stay alive,”
    says eighth-grader Emma Lewis. “Paying farmers well is really important
    because if we didn’t have any unprocessed food, we’d all be living on
    candy.”
    <br /><br />Eating morally, as some describe it, is becoming a priority for
    teenagers as well as adults in their early 20s. What began a decade ago as a
    concern on college campuses to shun clothing made in overseas sweatshops has
    given birth to a parallel phenomenon in the food and beverage industries.
    Here, youthful shoppers are leveraging their dollars in a bid to reduce
    pesticide usage, limit deforestation, and make sure farmers are not left
    with a pittance on payday. Once again, college campuses are setting the
    pace. Students at 30 colleges have helped persuade administrators to make
    sure all cafeteria coffee comes with a “Fair Trade” label, which means bean
    pickers in Latin America and Africa were paid higher than the going rates.
    Their peers on another 300 campuses are pushing to follow suit, according to
    Students United for Fair Trade in Washington, D.C. <br /><br />Coffee is
    just the beginning. Bon Appetit, an institutional food-service provider
    based in California, relies on organic and locally grown produce. In each
    year since 2001, more than 25 colleges have asked the company to bid on
    their food-service contracts. Though Bon Appetit intentionally limits its
    growth, its collegiate client list has grown from 58 to 71 in that period.
    “It’s really just been in the last five years that we’ve seen students
    become concerned with where their food was coming from,” says Maisie
    Ganzler, Bon Appetit’s director of strategic initiatives. “Prior to that,
    students were excited to be getting sugared cereal.” <br /><br />To reach a
    younger set that often does not drink coffee, Fair Trade importer Equal
    Exchange rolled our a line of cocoa in 2003 and chocolate bars in 2004.
    Profits in both sectors have justified the project, says Equal Exchange
    co-president Hob Everts. What is more, dozens of schools have contacted the
    firm to use its products in fundraisers and as classroom teaching, tools.
    "Kids often are the ones who agitate in the family’" for recycling and other
    eco-friendly practices, Mr. Everts says. “So, it’s a ripe audience.”
    <br /><br />Concerns of today’s youthful food shoppers seem to reflect in
    some ways the idealism that inspired prior generations to join boycotts in
    solidarity with farm workers. Today’s efforts are distinct in that youthful
    consumers say they do not want to make sacrifices. They want high-quality,
    competitively priced goods that do not require exploitation of workers or
    the environment. They will gladly reward companies that deliver. One
    activist who shares this sentiment and hears it repeatedly from her peers is
    Summer Rayne Oakes, a recent college graduate and fashion model who promotes
    stylish Fair Trade clothing. “I’m not going to buy something that can’t
    stand on its own or looks bad just because it’s socially responsible,” Ms.
    Oakes says. “My generation has come to terms with the fact that we’re all
    consumers, and we all buy something. So, if I do have to buy food, what are
    the consequences?” <br /><br />Wanting to ameliorate the world’s big
    problems can be frustrating, especially for those who feel ineffective
    because they are young. Marketers are figuring out that teenagers resent
    this feeling of powerlessness and are pushing products that make young
    buyers feel as though they are making a difference, says Michael Wood, vice
    president of Teenage Research Unlimited. His example: Ethos Water from
    Starbucks, which contributes five cents from every bottle sold to
    water-purification centres in developing countries. “This is a very easy way
    for young people to contribute. All they have to do is buy bottled water,”
    Mr. Wood says. “Buying products or supporting companies that give them ways
    to support global issues is one way for them to get involved, and they
    really appreciate that.” <br /><br />Convenience is also driving consumer
    activism. Joe Curnow, national coordinator of United Students for Fair
    Trade, says she first got involved about five years ago as a high schooler
    when she spent time hanging out in cafes. Buying coffee with an eco-friendly
    label “was a very easy way for me to express what I believed in”, she says.
    For young teens, consumption is their first foray into activism. At the
    Fayerweather Street School, Emma Lewis teamed up with classmates Kayla
    Kleinman and Therese LaRue to sell Fair Trade chocolate, cocoa, and other
    products at a school fundraiser in November. When the tally reached $8,000,
    they realised they were striking a chord. <br /><br />Some adults hasten to
    point out the limitations of ethical consumption as a tool for doing good
    deeds and personal growth. Gary Lindsay, director of Children’s Ministries,
    encourages Fair Trade purchases, but he also organises children to collect
    toys for foster children and save coins for a playground-construction
    project in Tanzania. He says it helps them learn to enjoy helping others
    even when they are not getting anything tangible in return. “When we're
    benefiting, how much are we really giving? Is it really sacri-lice?" Mr.
    Lindsay asks. Of Fair Trade products, he says: “Those things are great when
    we’re given opportunities like that once in a while, but I think for us to
    expect that we should get something out of everything we do is a very
    selfish attitude to have.”
