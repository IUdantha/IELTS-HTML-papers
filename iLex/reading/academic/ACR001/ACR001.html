  </p>

  <h2>The Vikings wayfaring way</h2>

  <p>
    In the last century, Vikings have been perceived in numerous diﬀerent ways –
    vilified as conquerors and romanticised as adventurers. How Vikings have
    been employed in nation-building is a topic of some interest.
  </p>

  <p>
    In English, Vikings are also known as Norse or Norsemen. Their language
    greatly inﬂuenced English, with the nouns, ‘Hell’, ‘husband’, ‘law’, and
    ‘window’, and the verbs, ‘blunder’, ‘snub’, ‘take’, and ‘want’, all coming
    from Old Norse. However, the origins of the word ‘Viking’, itself, are
    obscure: it may mean ‘a Scandinavian pirate’, or it may refer to ‘an inlet’,
    or a place called Vik, in modem-day Norway, from where the pirates came.
    These various names – Vikings, Norse, or Norsemen, and doubts about the very
    word ‘Viking’ suggest historical confusion.
  </p>

  <p>
    Loosely speaking, the Viking Age endured from the late eighth to the
    mid-eleventh centuries. Vikings sailed to England in AD 793 to storm coastal
    monasteries, and subsequently, large swathes of England fell under Viking
    rule – indeed several Viking kings sat on the English throne. It is
    generally agreed that the Battle of Hastings, in 1066, when the Norman
    French invaded, marks the end of the English Viking Age, but the Irish
    Viking age ended earlier, while Viking colonies in Iceland and Greenland did
    not dissolve until around AD 1500.
  </p>

  <p>
    How much territory Vikings controlled is also in dispute – Scandinavia and
    Western Europe certainly, but their reach east and south is uncertain. They
    plundered and settled down the Volga and Dnieper rivers, and traded with
    modem-day Istanbul, but the archaeological record has yet to verify that
    Vikings raided as far away as Northwest Africa, as some writers claim.
  </p>

  <p>
    The issue of control and extent is complex because many Vikings did not
    return to Scandinavia after raiding but assimilated into local populations,
    often becoming Christian. To some degree, the Viking Age is defined by
    religion. Initially, Vikings were polytheists, believing in many gods, but
    by the end of the age, they had permanently accepted a new monotheistic
    religious system – Christianity.
  </p>

  <p>
    This transition from so-called pagan plunderers to civilised Christians is
    significant and is the view promulgated throughout much of recent history.
    In the UK, in the 1970s for example, schoolchildren were taught that until
    the Vikings accepted Christianity they were nasty heathens who rampaged
    throughout Britain. By contrast, today’s children can visit museums where
    Vikings are celebrated as merchants, pastoralists, and artists with a unique
    worldview as well as conquerors.
  </p>

  <p>
    What are some other interpretations of Vikings? In the nineteenth century,
    historians in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden constructed their own Viking ages
    for nationalistic reasons. At that time, all three countries were in crisis.
    Denmark had been beaten in war and ceded territory to what is now Germany.
    Norway had become independent from Sweden in 1905 but was economically
    vulnerable, so Norwegians sought to create a separate identity for
    themselves in the past as well as the present. The Norwegian historian,
    Gustav Storm, was adamant it was his forebears and not the Swedes’ or Danes’
    who had colonised Iceland, Greenland, and Vinland, in what is now Canada.
    Sweden, meanwhile, had relinquished Norway to the Norwegians and Finland to
    the Russians; thus, in the late nineteenth century, Sweden was keen to boost
    its image with rich archaeological finds to show the glory of its Viking
    past.
  </p>

  <p>
    In addition to augmenting nationalism, nineteenth-century thinkers were
    influenced by an Englishman, Herbert Spencer, who described peoples and
    cultures in evolutionary terms similar to those of Charles Darwin. Spencer
    coined the phrase ‘survival of the fittest’, which includes the notion that,
    over time, there is not only technological but also moral progress.
    Therefore, Viking heathens’ adoption of Christianity was considered an
    advantageous move. These days, historians do not compare cultures in the
    same way, especially since, in this case, the archaeological record seems to
    show that heathen Vikings and Christian Europeans were equally brutal.
  </p>
  <p>
    Views of Vikings change according to not only to forces aﬀecting historians
    at the time of their research but also according to the materials they read.
    Since much knowledge of Vikings comes from literature composed up to 300
    years after the events they chronicle, some Danish historians cal1 these
    sources ‘mere legends’. Vikings did have a written language carved on large
    stones, but as few of these survive today, the most reliable contemporary
    sources on Vikings come from writers from other cultures, like the
    ninth-century Persian geographer, Ibn Khordadbeh.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the last four decades, there have been wildly varying interpretations of
    the Viking inﬂuence in Russia. Most non-Russian scholars believe the Vikings
    created a kingdom in western Russia and modern-day Ukraine led by a man
    called Rurik. After AD 862, Rurik’s descendants continued to rule. There is
    considerable evidence of this colonisation: in Sweden, carved stones, still
    standing, describe the conquerors’ journeys; both Russian and Ukrainian have
    loan words from Old Norse; and, Scandinavian first names, like Igor and
    Olga, are still popular. However, during the Soviet period, there was an
    emphasis on the Slavic origins of most Russians. (Appearing in the
    historical record around the sixth century AD, the Slavs are thought to have
    originated in Eastern Europe.) This Slavic identity was promoted to contrast
    with that of the neighbouring Viking Swedes, who were enemies during the
    Cold War.
  </p>

  <p>
    These days, many Russians consider themselves hybrids. Indeed recent genetic
    studies support a Norse-colonisation theory: western Russian DNA is
    consistent with that of the inhabitants of a region north of Stockholm in
    Sweden.
  </p>

  <p>
    The tools available to modern historians are many and varied, and their
    findings may seem less open to debate. There are linguistics, numismatics,
    dendrochronology, archaeozoology, palaeobotany, ice crystallography, climate
    and DNA analysis to add to the translation of runes and the raising of
    mighty warships. Despite these, historians remain children of their times.

      You should spend about 20 minutes on <b>Questions 15-27</b>, which are
      based on Reading Passage 2 below.
    </i>
  </p>

  <h2>The future never dies?</h2>

  <p>
    The prospects for humanity and for the world as a whole are somewhere
    between glorious and dire. It is hard to be much more precise.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>A</b><br />
    By ‘glorious’, I mean that our descendants – all who are born on to this
    Earth – could live very comfortably and securely, and could continue to do
    so for as long as the Earth can support life, which should be for a very
    long time indeed. We should at least be thinking in terms of the next
    million years. Furthermore, our descendants could continue to enjoy the
    company of other species – establishing a much better relationship with them
    than we have now. Other animals need not live in constant fear of us. Many
    of those fellow species now seem bound to become extinct, but a significant
    proportion could and should continue to live alongside us. Such a future may
    seem ideal, and so it is. Yet I do not believe it is fanciful. There is
    nothing in the physical fabric of the Earth or in our own biology to suggest
    that this is not possible.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>B</b><br />
    ‘Dire’ means that we human beings could be in deep trouble within the next
    few centuries, living but also dying in large numbers in political terror
    and from starvation, while huge numbers of our fellow creatures would simply
    disappear, leaving only the ones that we find convenient – chickens, cattle
    – or that we can’t shake off, like flies and mice. I’m taking it to be
    self-evident that glory is preferable.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>C</b><br />
    Our future is not entirely in our own hands because the Earth has its own
    rules, is part of the solar system and is neither stable nor innately safe.
    Other planets in the solar system are quite beyond habitation, because their
    temperature is far too high or too low to be endured, and ours, too, in
    principle could tip either way. Even relatively unspectacular changes in the
    atmosphere could do the trick. The core of the Earth is hot, which in many
    ways is good for living creatures, but every now and again, the molten rock
    bursts through volcanoes on the surface. Among the biggest volcanic
    eruptions in recent memory was Mount St Helens, in the USA, which threw out
    a cubic kilometre of ash – fortunately, in an area where very few people
    live. In 1815, Tambora (in present-day Indonesia) expelled so much ash into
    the upper atmosphere that climatic effects seriously harmed food production
    around the world for the season after season. Entire civilisations have been
    destroyed by volcanoes.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>D</b><br />
    Yet nothing we have so far experienced shows what volcanoes can really do.
    Yellowstone National Park in the USA occupies the caldera (the crater formed
    when a volcano collapses) of an exceedingly ancient volcano of extraordinary
    magnitude. Modem surveys show that its centre is now rising. Sometime in the
    next 200 million years, Yellowstone could erupt again, and when it does, the
    whole world will be transformed. Yellowstone could erupt tomorrow. But
    there’s a very good chance that it will give us another million years, and
    that surely is enough to be going on with. It seems sensible to assume that
    this will be the case.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>E</b><br />
    The universe at large is dangerous, too: in particular, we share the sky
    with vast numbers of asteroids, and now and again, they come into our
    planet’s atmosphere. An asteroid the size of a small island, hitting the
    Earth at 15,000 kilometres an hour (a relatively modest speed by the
    standards of heavenly bodies), would strike the ocean bed like a rock in a
    puddle, send a tidal wave around the world as high as a small mountain and
    as fast as a jumbo jet, and propel us into an ice age that could last for
    centuries. There are plans to head off such disasters (including rockets to
    push approaching asteroids into new trajectories), but in truth, it’s down
    to luck.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>F</b><br />
    On the other hand, the archaeological and the fossil evidence shows that no
    truly devastating asteroid has struck since the one that seems to have
    accounted for the extinction of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. So
    again, there seems no immediate reason for despair. The Earth is indeed an
    uncertain place, in an uncertain universe, but with average luck, it should
    do us well enough. If the world does become inhospitable in the next few
    thousand or million years, then it will probably be our own fault. In short,
    despite the underlying uncertainty, our own future and that of our fellow
    creatures are very much in our own hands.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>G</b><br />
    Given average luck on the geological and the cosmic scale, the difference
    between glory and disaster will be made and is being made, by politics.
    Certain kinds of political systems and strategies would predispose us to
    long-term survival (and indeed to comfort and security and pleasure of being
    alive), while others would take us more and more frenetically towards
    collapse. The broad point is, though, that we need to look at ourselves –
    humanity – and at the world in general in a quite new light. Our material
    problems are fundamentally those of biology. We need to think, and we need
    our politicians to think, biologically. Do that, and take the ideas
    seriously, and we are in with a chance. Ignore biology and we and our fellow
    creatures haven’t a hope.

  <h2>Cosmetics in Ancient Past</h2>

  <p>
    <b>A</b><br />
    Since cosmetics and perfumes are still in wide use today, it is interesting
    to compare the attitudes, customs and beliefs related to them in ancient
    times to those of our own day and age. Cosmetics and perfumes have been
    popular since the dawn of civilization; it is shown by the discovery of a
    great deal of pertinent archaeological material, dating from the third
    millennium BC. Mosaics, glass perfume flasks, stone vessels, ovens,
    cooking-pots, clay jars, etc., some inscribed by the hand of the artisan.
    Evidence also appears in the Bible and other classical writings, where it is
    written that spices and perfumes were prestigious products known throughout
    the ancient world and coveted by kings and princes. The written and
    pictorial descriptions, as well as archaeological findings, all show how
    important body care and aesthetic appearance were in the lives of the
    ancient people. The chain of evidence spans many centuries, detailing the
    usage of cosmetics in various cultures from the earliest period of recorded
    history.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>B</b><br />
    In antiquity, however, at least in the onset, cosmetics served in religious
    ceremonies and for healing purposes. Cosmetics were also connected with
    cultic worship and witchcraft: to appease the various gods, fragrant
    ointments were applied to the statuary images and even to their attendants.
    From this, in the course of time, developed the custom of personal use, to
    enhance the beauty of the face and the body, and to conceal defects.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>C</b><br />
    Perfumes and fragrant spices were precious commodities in antiquity, very
    much in demand, and at times even exceeded silver and gold in value.
    Therefore they were luxury products, used mainly in the temples and in the
    homes of the noble and wealthy. The Judean kings kept them in treasure
    houses (2 Kings 20:13). And the Queen of Sheba brought to Solomon “camels
    laden with spices, gold in great quantity and precious stones.” (1 Kings
    10:2, 10). However, within time, the use of cosmetics became the custom of
    that period. The use of cosmetics became widespread among the lower classes
    as well as among the wealthy; in the same way, they washed the body, so they
    used to care for the body with substances that softened the skin and anoint
    it with fragrant oils and ointments.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>D</b><br />
    Facial treatment was highly developed and women devoted many hours to it.
    They used to spread various scented creams on the face and to apply makeup
    in vivid and contrasting colors. An Egyptian papyrus from the 16th century
    BC contains detailed recipes to remove blemishes, wrinkles, and other signs
    of age. Greek and Roman women would cover their faces in the evening with a
    “beauty mask” to remove blemishes, which consisted mainly of flour mixed
    with fragrant spices, leaving it on their face all night. The next morning
    they would wash it off with asses’ milk. The very common creams used by
    women in the ancient Far East, particularly important in the hot climate and
    prevalent in that area of the globe, were made up of oils and aromatic
    scents. Sometimes the oil in these creams was extracted from olives,
    almonds, gourds, sesame, or from trees and plants; but, for those of limited
    means, scented animal and fish fats were commonly used.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>E</b><br />
    Women in the ancient past commonly put colors around their eyes. Besides
    beautification, its purpose was also medicinal as covering the sensitive
    skin of the lids with colored ointments that prevented dryness and eye
    diseases: the eye-paint repelled the little flies that transmitted eye
    inflammations. Egyptian women colored the upper eyelid black and the lower
    one green and painted the space between the upper lid and the eyebrow gray
    and blue. The women of Mesopotamia favored yellows and reds. The use of kohl
    for painting the eyes is mentioned three times in the Bible, always with
    disapproval by the sages (2 Kings, 9:30; Jeremiah 4:30; Ezekiel 23:40). In
    contrast, Job named one of his daughters “Keren Happukh”- “horn of eye
    paint” (Job 42:14).
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>F</b><br />
    Great importance was attached to the care for hair in ancient times. Long
    hair was always considered a symbol of beauty, and kings, nobles and
    dignitaries grew their hair long and kept it well-groomed and cared for.
    Women devoted much time to the style of the hair; while no cutting, they
    would apply much care to it by arranging it skillfully in plaits and
    “building it up” sometimes with the help of wigs. Egyptian women generally
    wore their hair flowing down to their shoulders or even longer. In
    Mesopotamia, women cherished long hair as a part of their beauty, and hair
    flowing down their backs in a thick plait and tied with a ribbon is seen in
    art. Assyrian women wore their hair shorter, braiding and binding it in a
    bun at the back. In Ancient Israel, brides would wear their hair long on the
    wedding day as a sign of their virginity. Ordinary people and slaves,
    however, usually wore their hair short, mainly for hygienic reasons, since
    they could not afford to invest in the kind of treatment that long hair
    required.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>G</b><br />
    From the Bible and Egyptian and Assyrian sources, as well as the words of
    classical authors, it appears that the centers of the trade-in aromatic
    resins and incense were located in the kingdoms of southern Arabia, and even
    as far as India, where some of these precious aromatic plants were grown.
    “Dealers from Sheba and Rammah dealt with you, offering the choicest
    spices…” (Ezekiel 27:22). The Nabateans functioned as the important
    middlemen in this trade; Palestine also served as a very important
    component, as the trade routes crisscrossed the country. It is known that
    the Egyptian Queen Hatsheput (15th century BC) sent a royal expedition to
    the Land of Punt (Somalia) in order to bring back myrrh seedlings to plant
    in her temple. In Assyrian records of tribute and spoils of war, perfumes
    and resins are mentioned; the text from the time of Tukulti-Ninurta II
    (890–884 BC) refers to balls of myrrh as a part of the tribute brought to
    the Assyrian king by the Aramaean kings. The trade-in spices and perfumes
    are also mentioned in the Bible as written in Genesis (37:25–26), “Camels
    carrying gum tragacanth and balm and myrrh”.
