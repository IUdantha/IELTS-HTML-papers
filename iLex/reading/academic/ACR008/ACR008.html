  <h3>The Liquid-Propellant Rocket and Alternatives</h3>

  <p>
    A liquid-propellant rocket is a rocket whose engine uses propellants in
    liquid form to power it. The reasonably high density of liquids makes them a
    desirable form of engine power as the volume of propellant tanks used to
    hold them can be relatively low. Lightweight pumps can also be used to pump
    the liquid propellant from the tanks into the engine, which means the
    propellant can be kept under low pressure. Both these factors, smaller tanks
    and lighter pumps, are advantageous as they effectively lower the rocket’s
    mass ratio. <br /><br />One of the most common types of liquid-propellant
    rocket is the bipropellant rocket. Bipropellant rockets generally have two
    tanks: the topmost one which contains liquid fuel, and a second, typically
    slightly larger tank, containing a liquid oxidiser such as liquid hydrogen
    or a hydrocarbon fuel, liquid oxygen combination. The fuel tank and the
    oxidiser are connected to the combustion chamber by pumps. It is within the
    chamber that the fuel and oxidiser react and combust. This chamber, in turn,
    connects to the nozzle through which spent fuel is expelled, generating
    sufficient thrust to get the rocket airborne. <br /><br />Liquid-propellant
    rockets are preferred to other types primarily because they have a higher
    energy content, thus generating more thrust. Tankage efficiency is another
    important factor. Liquid propellant will typically have a density similar to
    water and require only modest pressure to prevent vapourisation from
    occurring. This combination of high density and low pressure permits a very
    lightweight tank. Gasses, on the other hand, are not nearly as dense and
    require more pressure to be applied in order to keep them stored within the
    tank, meaning heavier tankage must be used, which results in a higher
    rocket’s mass ratio. <br /><br />Other advantages of liquid-propellant
    rockets include the fact that they can be reused for several flights, as
    happened many times in the Space Shuttle programme operated by NASA, and the
    ability to shut down and reignite such rockets multiple times if necessary.
    That said, the use of liquid propellants has been associated with a number
    of issues. One such issue is termed slosh (the movement of a liquid inside
    another object already undergoing motion). Slosh can lead to loss of control
    of the vehicle and it can also confuse computerised guidance systems, which
    are not equipped to account for the random path disturbances it can cause.
    Another major drawback of this kind of rocket is the functional complexity
    of the liquid-propellant mechanism, which operates high speed moving parts
    at very high temperatures. This can be a recipe for disaster, as it
    increases the probability of something going wrong. <br /><br />The pumps
    used to pump the liquid propellants, though lightweight, are also very hard
    to design, and this is another bone of contention with proponents of other
    forms of rocket propellant. These turbopumps, as they are known, can suffer
    serious failures, such as overspeeding or shedding when operated at high
    speed. <br /><br />Essentially, liquid-propellant rockets must be fine-tuned
    and they operate with a very small margin for error. They are, therefore,
    very high-maintenance, taking into consideration build, design, storage and
    flight logistics. However, if the logistical complications can be overcome,
    the reward is a highly effective, precise instrument that is relatively
    lightweight and can be reused more than once - a huge plus point when the
    expense of building a new rocket is factored in. <br /><br />Solid-fuel
    rockets have been in existence much longer, and their main advantage over
    the liquid-propellant rocket is their long storage life. Solid-fuel rockets
    can be stored indefinitely and can then be readied for redeployment and
    operation in a relatively short space of time. They are also less volatile
    and for that reason can be transported more easily from place to place. This
    explains the military’s preference for solid-fuel rockets when it comes to
    its missile cache. <br /><br />On the other hand, while NASA does deploy
    solid-fuel rockets in the initial stages of a space shuttle launch,
    primarily for their superior initial thrust, it relies on liquid-propellant
    rockets in the latter stages as these rockets provide thrust for longer
    periods. <br /><br />In an attempt to capture the best aspects of both
    rocket types - solid and liquid (gas, realistically, being far too volatile)
    -hybrid rocket models have recently emerged. These are mechanically and
    functionally simpler machines, as they require one, not two, liquid tank.
    They are also superior from a safety perspective as they can be loaded
    onsite, so they are effectively transported in a benign state and do not
    represent a hazard in transit (this type of hazard is a major drawback of
    conventional rockets). At present, it is mainly space science agencies that
    are researching the potential of hybrid rockets

      based on Reading Passage 2 below.

  <h3>Education Cuts Counterproductive to Long-Term Goals</h3>

  <p>
    In the latest so-called league table of universities around the world, Irish
    institutes have performed comparatively poorly, with only one of the 'big
    three' making progress in the right direction through the rankings. Arguably
    Ireland's most prestigious university, Trinity College Dublin registered a
    sharp fall and has now gone from being just outside the top 50 in the world,
    placed in position 52 last year, to 65th twelve months later. University
    College Dublin fared even worse in the World University Rankings, and now
    lies in 134th place, some 20 places worse off than it was last year. The
    only good news, and it was hardly something to write home about, came by way
    of University College Cork's modest rise from 184th to 181 st place.
    <br /><br />University presidents were quick to blame cutbacks for the
    slippage and have criticised the government for taking funding out of
    third-level education, claiming that this will undermine our reputation as a
    very well-educated workforce in the long term and damage the prospects for a
    meaningful economic recovery over the next ten to fifteen years for this
    debt-ridden country. <br /><br />UCD president Hugh Brady was quick to
    highlight the futility of Irish universities' attempts to compete with their
    British and American counterparts. Brady points out that UK universities now
    charge undergraduate students on average €10,000 per annum. In America, the
    cost of university education can be even more excessive. <br /><br />Here in
    Ireland, third-level education is still free, but there are calls for fees
    to be reintroduced, otherwise this years' slide down the rankings is likely
    to be repeated again in 12 months' time. <br /><br />Another option open to
    Irish universities is to gain more of a foothold in the market for
    attracting foreign students. Tapping deeper into the global education market
    would prove very lucrative and, as funding continues to be pulled out of
    third-level education by the government, this is now seen as crucial for the
    future in this country. However, the Irish universities' poor performance in
    the rankings is a double-edged sword; not only is it harming their
    international reputation, but in doing so, it is also making it more
    difficult to attract foreign fee-paying students for enrolment in years to
    come. And yet, without the funding such students provide, Irish universities
    will continue to plot a downward course in the rankings. It is a vicious
    circle. <br /><br />Ironically, in making it harder for local universities
    to compete on the global stage by cutting funding, the government is
    undermining its own policy agenda, which is to attract double the number of
    foreign students each year by 2018. The economics of this policy are sound;
    Ireland currently attracts around 26,000 foreign students per annum. Each
    international student spends an average of €20,000 in fees and expenses, so
    it is clear to see how doubling the number would provide a massive boost for
    the economy and much-needed funding for the universities themselves.
    <br /><br />Moreover, in the long run, as these well-educated and highly
    skilled international students would hopefully depart Ireland with a
    positive impression of the country, they would open up new trading and
    investment opportunities as they returned home to their native countries.
    This is obviously a very sensible government policy, which makes the
    government's decision to divert funding away from education all the more
    short-sighted and counterproductive. <br /><br />As for the calls to
    reintroduce university fees, these have been met with understandable anger
    from both parent and student groups. The Students' Association of Ireland
    has threatened to organise a huge protest march, should it get even the
    slightest hint that there is some support in government circles for this
    proposal. Union president, Michael Carmody, promises to bring the city
    centre to a complete standstill and cause widespread disruption to business
    and services if the government approves any plans for the reintroduction of
    fees. 'We will not take this lying down', he said. 'Ireland is not a
    classist society and we are very proud of that. Everyone has an equal
    opportunity to attend third-level courses no matter how well-off their
    parents are or what their background is. If we allow fees to be
    reintroduced, university will become the preserve of an elite few; either
    that or, as is the case in Britain, students will be burdened with huge
    debts for the rest of their lives. No. We will not stand idly by and let
    this happen.

  <h1>READING PASSAGE 3</h1>

      You should spend about 20 minutes on <b>Questions 27-40</b>, which are
      based on Reading Passage 3 below.

  <h3>Is paradise forever lost?</h3>

  <ol type="A">
    <li>
      These days, it has almost become a cliche - the notion of travelling on a
      shoestring is far too common for the liking of the free spirited hippie
      types who started the craze off. And, besides, with the cost of travel
      having plummeted in recent years, it no longer entails enduring the kinds
      of hardships experienced by the budget travellers of yesteryear. And, in
      some ways, this has taken the enjoyment out of the experience of ‘roughing
      it’ as you travel around the world in search of new and ever more unique
      experiences. Why? Because there aren’t that many new and unique
      experiences left. Once everyone started doing it, this whole
      globe-trotting idea started to look a lot less attractive. It was supposed
      to be for a select few adventurers daring enough to take the dusty roads
      less trodden. But those roads are now crowded highways of overexcited
      youths trying desperately to make their holiday adventures special. There
      is something very artificial about the whole experience. Part of the
      reason people used to go backpacking to the ends of the earth was to,
      well, escape the maddening crowd, not join it. Is there nowhere that is
      safe anymore? Is there no escape from the masses?
    </li>
    <li>
      Rex, 25, from Kensington, dropped out of Engineering in his second year at
      Oxford to travel the world. An idealist and romantic, Rex had become
      disillusioned with life in the big smoke, having lived in London for most
      of his 25 years, and decided it was time to branch out. His parents were
      understandably distraught to learn of his decision to quit university, but
      they gave him their full support once it was clear this was the only thing
      that would make him happy. So Rex started down the by now well-documented
      road to Asia and the Far East. At first brimming with enthusiasm, his
      passion for the journey soon dried up when Rex realised things were not
      exactly as he had imagined they would be. No matter where he went, a
      dedicated army of foreigners like himself would follow; there was no
      escaping them, and so, Rex felt, the experience of local culture was very
      artificial, almost deliberately extreme to impress the eager eyes of his
      mainly American travel buddies.
    </li>
    <li>
      Having almost given up on ever finding the authentic experience, Rex
      prepared to come home. You can hear it from the horse’s mouth from here:
      ‘I got this deal with a stopover in Greece on route back to London, so I
      figured I might as well spend a few days there if for no other reason than
      to avoid having to face the music from my parents when I arrived home. I’d
      heard the Ionian islands were nice, but horribly overcrowded. Still I
      thought: “What’s the point of fighting it? Everywhere’s crowded.”
      <br />So, a couple of days later, I found myself in Corfu on a beautiful
      spring day in March. It was 25 degrees outside; the sky was clear and the
      sea a picture-postcard turquoise. Surprisingly, there weren’t that many
      tourists on the island either. Suddenly my spirits got high. That first
      evening, I dined in the old town on some exquisite local fare at a small,
      family-owned taverna where the owner - a chubby, middle-aged man of very
      good nature - proceeded to introduce me (his only customer) to the rest of
      his family one-by-one, then sat down and chatted by my side in his broken
      English for the rest of the night.’
    </li>
    <li>
      ‘I told him where I was going next and the man’s eyes beamed. Kefalonia,
      he explained, was where he had grown up. Indeed, his village was only a
      mile or two from the hostel where I would be staying. It was settled then;
      I would stay with his brother Nikos, who would give me a “royal” tour of
      the island, instead. Nikos, it turned out, was every bit as helpful as his
      older brother, and, somehow, by accident, I found myself spending the next
      two months in the company of his family as they showed me from one part of
      Kefalonia to the next, exploring land and sea, caves and rivers,
      waterfalls and lakes, forests and mountains. This was real; Nikos was
      real; his wife and children were real; their hospitality was real and
      Kefalonia was real. The turtles I swam with were real; it was just me and
      Nikos’ daughter Eliza who’d chanced upon them by accident in the fishing
      boat. There were no crowds to spoil this moment; everything was real. One
      evening, as I sat looking out onto the sunset, totally relaxed and at home
      on my little island paradise, a bus came bumping up the uneven road that
      led to the beach. Then, within minutes, there were 20 or 30 bodies on my
      beach, throwing balls, kicking sand, drinking beer, lighting fires...
      “Summer has arrived”, I thought. And with it, I made a hasty retreat back
      to London. It occurred to me then, that, even in the most commercialised
      of tourist destinations like the Greek Islands, if you know what to look
      for, where to look and, more importantly, when, you can still find
      paradise, if only for a few moments.’
    </li>
    <li>
      Rex’s story is a reminder to keep searching until you find what you are
      looking for. Rex found his paradise in the most unlikely of places. Greece
      has a reputation for attracting hoards of package-holiday goers. It is a
      place where beaches are overflowing with deckchairs and sunbeds and the
      stench of commercialism from June to September each year. But, as Rex
      found out, for the rest of the year it transforms into something magical,
      or, at least, a small part of it - a quiet, peaceful, little gem of an
      island on the shores of the Ionian Sea, does. Keep searching!
