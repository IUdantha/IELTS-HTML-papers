  <h3>UNDOING OUR EMOTIONS</h3>
  <p>
    <b>A.</b> Three generations ago, 180 young women wrote essays describing why
    they wanted to join a convent (a religious community of nuns). Years later,
    a team of psychological researchers came across these autobiographies in the
    convent’s archives. The researchers were seeking material to confirm earlier
    studies hinting at a link between having a good vocabulary in youth and a
    low risk of Alzheimer’s disease in old age. What they found was even more
    amazing. The researchers found that, although the young women were in their
    early twenties when they wrote their essays, the emotions expressed in these
    writings were predictive of how long they would live: those with upbeat
    autobiographies lived more than ten years longer than those whose language
    was more neutral. Deborah Danner, a psychologist at the University of
    Kentucky who spearheaded the study, noted that the results were particularly
    striking because all members of the convent lived similar lifestyles,
    eliminating many variables that normally make it difficult to interpret
    longevity studies. It was a phenomenal finding’, she says. ‘A researcher
    gets a finding like that maybe once in a lifetime.’ However, she points out
    that no one has been able to determine why positive emotions might have such
    life-extending effects. <br /><br /><b>B.</b> Barbara Fredrickson, Professor
    of Psychology at the University of Michigan, believes that part of the
    answer is the ‘undo effect’. According to this theory, positive emotions
    help you live longer by shutting down the effects of negative ones.
    Fredrickson’s theory begins with the observation that negative emotions,
    like fear and stress, enhance our flight-or-fight response to very real
    threats. However, even when the emergency is gone, negative emotions produce
    lingering effects. Brooks Gump, a stress researcher at the State University
    of New York, explains that one of these effects is excessive cardiovascular
    reactivity. Behaviourally, Gump says, this reactivity is related to
    excessive vigilance: the state of being constantly on guard for potential
    dangers. Not only is it physically draining to live in a perpetual state of
    high vigilance, but high cardiovascular reactivity could be linked to
    increased chances of a heart attack. <br /><br /><b>C.</b> Fredrickson
    believes positive emotions work their magic by producing a rapid unwinding
    of pent-up tension, restoring the system to normal. People who quickly
    bounce back from stress often speed the process by harnessing such emotions
    as amusement, interest, excitement, and happiness, she says. To test her
    theory, Fredrickson told a group of student volunteers that they had only a
    few minutes to prepare a speech that would be critiqued by experts. After
    letting the students get nervous about that, Fredrickson then told them they
    wouldn’t actually have to deliver their speeches. She monitored heart rates
    and blood pressure. Not surprisingly, all students got nervous about their
    speeches, but those who viewed the experiment with good-humored excitement
    saw their heart rates return to normal much more quickly than those who were
    angry about being fooled. In a second experiment, Fredrickson reported that
    even those who normally were slow to bounce back could be coached to recover
    more quickly by being told to view the experiment as a challenge, rather
    than a threat. <br /><br /><b>D.</b> Fredrickson believes that positive
    emotions make people more flexible and creative. Negative emotions, she
    says, give a heightened sense of detail that makes us hypersensitive to
    minute clues related to the source of a threat. But that also produces
    ‘tunnel vision’ in which we ignore anything unrelated to the danger.
    Fredrickson speculated that just as positive emotions can undo the
    cardiovascular effects of negative ones, they may also reverse the
    attention-narrowing effects of negative feelings: broadening our
    perspectives. <br /><br /><b>E.</b> To verify her theory, Fredrickson showed
    a group of students some film clips- some saw frightening clips, some saw
    humorous ones or peaceful ones. They then did a matching test in which they
    were shown a simple drawing and asked which of two other drawings it most
    resembled. The drawings were designed so that people would tend to give one
    answer if they focused on details, and another answer if they focused on the
    big picture. The results confirmed Fredrickson’s suspicion that positive
    emotions affect our perceptions. Students who had seen the humorous or
    peaceful clips were more likely to match objects according to broad
    impressions. <br /><br /><b>F.</b> This fits with the role that positive
    emotions might have played in early human tribes, Fredrickson says. Negative
    emotions provided focus, which was important for surviving in life-or-death
    situations, but the ability to feel positive emotions was of long-term value
    because it opened the mind to new ideas. Humour is a good example of this.
    She says: ‘The emotions are transient, but the resources are durable. If you
    building a friendship through being playful, that friendship is a lasting
    resource.’ So while the good feelings may pass, the friendship remains. On
    an individual level, Fredrickson’s theory also says that taking time to do
    things that make you feel happy isn’t simply self-indulgent. Not only are
    these emotions good for the individual, but they are also good for society.
    <br /><br /><b>G.</b> Other researchers are intrigued by Fredrickson’s
    findings. Susan Folkman, of the University of California, has spent two
    decades studying how people cope with long-term stresses such as
    bereavement, or caring for a chronically ill child. Contrary to what one
    might expect, she says, these people frequently experience positive
    emotions. ‘These emotions aren’t there by accident’, she adds. ‘Mother
    Nature doesn’t work that way, I think that they give a person time out from
    the intense stress to restore their resources and keep going. This is very
    consistent with Fredrickson’s work.’

      You should spend about 20 minutes on <b>Questions 14-27</b>, which are
      based on Reading Passage 2 below.

  </p>

  <h3>Caveat Scriptor</h3>

  <p>
    Let the would-be writer beware! Anyone foolhardy enough to embark on a
    career as a writer – whether it be an academic treatise, a novel, or even an
    article – should first read this!
    <br /><br />People think that writing as a profession is glamorous; that it
    is just about sitting down and churning out words on a page, or more likely
    these days on a computer screen. If only it were! So what exactly does
    writing a book entail? Being a writer is about managing a galaxy of
    contradictory feelings: elation, despair, hope, frustration, satisfaction
    and depression-and not all separately! Of course, it also involves carrying
    out detailed research: first to establish whether there is a market for the
    planned publication, and second what should be the content of the book.
    Sometimes, however, instinct takes the place of market research and the
    contents are dictated not by plans and exhaustive research, but by
    experience and knowledge. <br /><br />Once the publication has been embarked
    upon, there is a long period of turmoil as the text takes shape. A first
    draft is rarely the final text of the book. Nearly all books are the result
    of countless hours of altering and re-ordering chunks of text and deleting
    the superfluous bits. While some people might think that with new’
    technology the checking and editing process is sped up, the experienced
    writer would hardly agree. Unfortunately, advanced technology now allows the
    writer the luxury of countless editing’s; a temptation many writers find
    hard to resist. So a passage, endlessly re-worked may end up nothing
    remotely like the original, and completely out of place when compared with
    the rest of the text. <br /><br />After the trauma of self-editing and
    looking for howlers, it is time to show the text to other people, friends
    perhaps, for appraisal. At this stage, it is not wise to send it off to a
    literary agent or direct to publishers, as it may need further fine-tuning
    of which the author is unaware. Once an agent has been approached and has
    rejected a draft publication, it is difficult to go and ask for the re
    vamped text to be considered again. It also helps, at this stage, to offer a
    synopsis of the book, if it is a novel, or an outline if it is a textbook.
    This acts as a guide for the author, and a general reference for friends and
    later for agents. Although it is tempting to send the draft to every
    possible agent at one time, it is probably unwise. Some agents may reject
    the publication out of hand, but others may proffer some invaluable advice,
    for example about content or the direction to be taken, information such as
    this may be of use in finally being given a contract by an agent or
    publisher. <br /><br />The lucky few taken on by publishers or agents, then
    have their books subjected to a number of readers, whose job it is to vet a
    book: deciding whether it is worth publishing and whether the text as it
    stands is acceptable or not. After a book has finally been accepted by a
    publisher, one of the greatest difficulties for the writer lies in taking on
    board the publisher’s alterations to the text. Whilst the overall story and
    thrust of the book may be acceptable, it will probably have to conform to an
    in-house style, as regards language, spelling and punctuation. More
    seriously, the integrity of the text may be challenged, and this may require
    radical re-drafting which is usually unpalatable to the author. A books
    creation period is complex and unnerving, but the publisher’s reworkings and
    text amputations can also be a tortuous process. <br /><br />For many
    writers, the most painful period comes when the text has been accepted, and
    the writer is wailing for it to be put together for the printer. By this
    stage, it is not uncommon for the writer to be thoroughly sick of the text.
    <br /><br />Abandon writing? Nonsense. Once smitten, it is not easy to
    escape the compulsion to create and write, despite the roller-coaster ride
    of contradictory emotions.

  <p>
    People often associate writing with
    <input type="text" name="q14" placeholder="14" style="width: 160px" />. But
    being a writer involves managing conflicting emotions as well as
    <input type="text" name="q15" placeholder="15" style="width: 160px" />
    and instinct. Advanced technology, contrary to what might be thought, does
    not make the
    <input type="text" name="q16" placeholder="16" style="width: 160px" />
    faster. When a writer has a draft of the text ready, it is a good idea to
    have a
    <input type="text" name="q17" placeholder="17" style="width: 160px" />

      You should spend about 20 minutes on <b>Questions 27-40</b>, which are
      based on Reading Passage 3 below.
    </i>
  </p>

  <h3>Pronunciation and physiognomy</h3>

  <p>
    Imagine the scene: you are sitting on the tube and on gets someone you
    instinctively feel is American. To make sure you ask them the time, and arc
    fight, but how did you know?
    <br /><br />When we say someone ‘looks American’, we take into consideration
    dress, mannerism and physical appearance. However, since the Americans do
    not constitute one single race, what exactly is meant by ‘look’? In fact,
    one salient feature is a pronounced widening around the jaw – a
    well-documented phenomenon. <br /><br />Writer Arthur Koestler once remarked
    that friends of his, whom he had met thirty years after they emigrated to
    the United States, had acquired an ‘American physiognomy’, i.e. a broadened
    jaw, an appearance which is also prevalent in the indigenous population. An
    anthropologist friend of his attributed this to the increased use of the jaw
    musculature in American enunciation. This ‘change of countenance’ in
    immigrants had already been observed by the historian M. Fishberg in 1910.
    <br /><br />To paraphrase the philosopher Emerson, certain national, social
    and religious groups, such as ageing actors, long-term convicts and celibate
    priests, to give just a few examples, develop a distinguishing ‘look’, which
    is not easily defined, but readily recognised. Their way of life affects
    their facial expression and physical features, giving the mistaken
    impression that these traits are of hereditary or ‘racial’ origin. All the
    factors mentioned above contribute, as well as heredity. But the question of
    appearance being affected by pronunciation – as in the case of American
    immigrant including those from other English speaking countries over the
    course of many years – is of great interest, and calls for further study
    into the science of voice production. This can only benefit those working in
    the field of speech therapy, elocution and the pronunciation of foreign
    languages, and help the student from a purely physiological point of view.
    Naturally, the numerous psychological and socio-linguistic factors that
    inhibit most adult learners of foreign languages from acquiring ‘good’
    pronunciation constitute a completely different and no less important issue
    that require separate investigation. <br /><br />The pronunciation of the
    various forms of English around the world today is affected by the voice
    being ‘placed’ in different, parts of the mouth. We use our Speech organs in
    certain ways to produce specific sounds, and these muscles have to practise
    to learn new phonemes. Non-Americans should look in the mirror while
    repeating ‘1 really never heard of poor reward for valour’ with full use of
    tile USA retroflex /r/ phoneme, and note what happens to their jawbones
    after three or four repetitions. Imagine the effect of these movements on
    the jaw muscles after twenty years! This phoneme is one of the most
    noticeable features of US English and one that non-Americans always
    exaggerate when mimicking the accent. Likewise, standard British RP is often
    parodied, and its whine of superiority mocked to the point of turning the
    end of one’s nose up as much as possible. Not only does this enhance the
    ‘performance’, but also begs the question of whether this look is the origin
    of the expression ‘stuck up’? <br /><br />Once on a Birmingham bus, a friend
    pointed to a fellow passenger and said, ‘That man’s Brummie accent is
    written all over his face.’ This was from someone who would not normally
    make crass generalisations. The interesting thing would be to establish
    whether thin lips and a tense, prominent chin are a result of the way
    Midlands English is spoken, or its cause, or a mixture of both. Similarly,
    in the case of Liverpool one could ask whether the distinctive ‘Scouse
    accent was a reason for, or the frequency of high cheekbones in the local
    population.

    <br /><br />When one learns another accent, as in the theatre for example,
    voice coaches often resort to images to help their students acquire the
    distinctive sound of the target pronunciation. With ‘Scouse’, the mental aid
    employed is pushing your cheekbones up in a smile as high as they will go
    and you have got a very slack mouth full of cotton wool. The sound seems to
    spring off die sides of your face-outwards and upwards. For a Belfast
    accent, one has to tighten the sides of the jaws until there is maximum
    tension, and speak opening the lips as little as possible, This gives rise
    to the well-known ‘Ulster jaw’ phenomenon. Learning Australian involves
    imagining the ordeals of the first westerners transported to the other side
    of the world. When exposed to the merciless glare and unremitting heat of
    the southern sun, we instinctively screw up our eyes and grimace for
    protection. <br /><br />Has this contributed to an Australian ‘look’, and
    affected the way ‘Aussies’ speak English, or vice versa? It is a curious
    chicken and egg conundrum, but perhaps the answer is ultimately irrelevant
    Of course other factors affect the way people look and sound, and it would
    certainly be inaccurate to suggest that all those who speak one form of a
    language or dialect have a set physiognomy because of their pronunciation
    patterns. But a large enough number do, and that alone is worth
    investigating. What is important, however, is establishing pronunciation as
    one of the factors that determine physiognomy, and gaining a deeper insight
    into the origins and nature of the sounds of speech And of course, one
    wonders what ‘look’ one’s own group has!
