<strong>How the mind ages</strong><br /><br />
The way mental function changes is largely determined by three factors-mental
lifestyle, the impact of chronic disease and flexibility of the mind.<br /><br />

Experiments have shown that younger monkeys consistently outperform their older
colleagues on memory tests. Formerly, psychologists concluded that memory and
other mental functions in humans deteriorate over time because of changes in the
brain. Thus mental decline after young adulthood appeared inevitable. The truth,
however, is not quite so simple.<br /><br />

Stanley Rapoport at the National Institute of Health in the United States
measured the flow of blood in the brains of old and young people as they
completed different tasks. Since blood flow reflects neural activity. Rapoport
could compare which networks of neurons were the same, the neural networks they
used were significantly different. The older subjects used different internal
strategies to accomplish comparable results at the same time,'Rapoport says. At
the Georgia Institute of Technology, psychologist Timothy Salthouse compared a
group of fast and accurate typists of college age with another group in their
60s. Both groups typed 60 words a minute. The older typists, it turned out,
achieved their speed with cunning little strategies that made them more
efficient than their younger counterparts. They made fewer finger shifts,
gaining a fraction of a second here and there. They also read ahead in the test.
The neural networks involved in typing appear to have been reshaped to
compensate for losses in motor skills or other age changes.<br /><br />

In fact, there's evidence that deterioration in mental functions can actually be
reversed. Neuropsychologist Marion Diamond at the University of California has
shown that mental activity maks neurons sprout new dendrites* which establish
connections with other neurons. The dendrites shrink when the mind is idle. For
example,'when a rat is kept in isolation, the animal's brain shrinks, but if we
put that rat with other rats in a large cage and give them an assortment of
toys, we can show, after four days, significant differences in its brain.'says
Diamond. After a month in the enriched surroundings, the whole cerebral cortex
has expanded, as has its blood supply.'But even in the enriched surroundings,
rats get bored unless the toys are varied. Animals are just like we are. They
need stimulation,'says Diamond. A busy mental lifestyle keeps the human mind
fit, says Warner Schaie of Penn State University. ‘People who regularly
participate in challenging tasks retain their intellectual abilities better than
mental couch potatoes.' <br /><br />

In his studies, Schaie detected a decline in mental function among individuals
who underwent lengthy stays in hospital for chronic illness. He postulated it
might be due to the mental passivity encouraged by hospital routine.<br /><br />

One of the most profoundly important mental functions is memory. Memory exists
in more than one form, what we call knowledge- facts- is what psychologists such
as Harry Bahrick of Ohio Wesleyan University call semantic memory. Events,
conversations and occurrences in time and space, on the other hand, make up
episodic memory. It's true that episodic memory begins to decline when most
people are in their 50s, but it's never perfect at any age. <br /><br />

Probing the longevity of knowledge, Bahrick tested 1,000 high school graduates
to see how well they remembered the school subject algebra. Some had completed
the course a month before, other 50 years earlier. Surprisingly, he found that a
person's grasp of algebra did not depend on how long ago he'd taken the course.
The determining factor was the duration of instruction. Those who had spent only
a few months learning algebra forgot most of it within two or three years while
others who had been instructed for longer remembered better. According to
Bahrick,'the long-term residue of knowledge remains stable over the decades,
independent of the age of the person and the memory.' <br /><br />

Perhaps even more important than the ability to remember is the ability to
manage memory- a mental function known as metamemory.'You could say metamemory
is a byproduct of going to school,'says psychologist Robert Kail of Purdue
University,'The question-and-answer process,especially exam taking, helps
children learn and teaches them how their memory functions.This may be one
reason why the better educated a person is, the more likely they are to perform
well in many aspects of life and in psychological assessments: A group of adult
novice chess players were compared with a group of child experts at the game.
But when asked to remember the patterns of chess pieces arranged on a board, the
children won.' Because they'd played a lot of chess, their knowledge of chess
was better organized than that of the adults, and their existing knowledge of
chess served as a framework for new memory,'explains Kail. Cognitive style,
another factor in maintaining mental function, is what Schaie calls the ability
to adapt and roll with life's punches.'He measured mental flexibility with
questions and tests requiring people to carry out in an offbeat way an everyday
activity they had done millions of times. One example was asking people to copy
a paragraph substituting uppercase letters for lowercase ones. These tests seem
silly, but flexible-minded people manage to complete them,'says Schaie. The
rigid person responds with tension instead and performs poorly. Those who score
highly on tests of cognition at an advanced age are those who tested high in
mental flexibility at middle age'. <br /><br />

On a more optimistic note, one mental resource that only improves with time is
specialized knowledge. Crystallised intelligence about one's occupation
apparently does not decline at all until at least age 75. Vocabulary is another
such specialized form of knowledge. Research clearly shows that vocabulary
develops with time. Retired teachers and journalists consistently score higher
on tests of vocabulary and general information than college students.

<strong><u>The Art of Gift-Giving</u></strong
><br /><br />

A. Anticipation builds, the wrapping paper is ripped off in happy expectation...
And then, our enthusiasm takes a downturn as we extricate a jokey Christmas
pullover, a pair of woolen socks or a knitted tea cosy. Yes, we have all been
there. However, recent scientific research on how to give the ideal gift could
be set to change all that.<br /><br />

B. Yale researcher Novemsky claims to have singled out the factor that
determines if a gift will be well received or not. Perceived ease of use is
apparently paramount in the eyes of the recipient. A non-user-friendly gift will
therefore lead to disappointment, however expensive the actual gift might have
been.<br /><br />

C. Another tip for successful gift-giving is to avoid giving unsolicited
presents. We often try to second-guess the would-be recipient's taste, believing
our personal effort will be appreciated. But this invariably results in
disappointment for the recipient of the gift. Far better is a gift that has
actually been explicitly requested by the recipient than one chosen by the
giver, according to a study conducted by researchers Francis Flynn and Francesca
Gina (Journal of Experimental and Social Psychology 2011). So, best to save
fruitless hours spent trawling the internet for gifts or pounding the high
streets in vain and just be direct: ask the recipient what they want, then give
it to them; simple as that!<br /><br />

D. A further tip which flies in the face of conventional thinking with regard to
present-giving is to err on the side of frugality. In accordance with a 2014
study by Flynn and Gabriella Adams, the receiver's happiness was not found to be
directly proportional to the money spent on a gift. In the study, recipients
were given cheaper and more expensive versions of a variety of items, ranging
from an iPad to jewellery, wine and books. In all cases, the costlier gift was
not valued more than the cheaper option. The thought, therefore, really does
count.<br /><br />

E. An interesting extension to this study is that this finding holds true for
one of the most expensive and status-conscious gifts: that of the engagement
ring. Whilst diamonds may be a girl's best friend, as the saying goes, they do
not necessarily have to be top-of-the-range to win a girl's heart. Cheaper
alternatives are just as valued as their costlier counterparts.<br /><br />

F. If you have successfully negotiated the minefield of present-buying, then you
still aren't home and dry yet. Another hurdle has yet to be overcome:
present-wrapping. Failure to appropriately wrap a present can undo all the
effort you have put into buying the gift so far. A perfectly wrapped present is
always more welcome than a hastily wrapped one, unless the gift is markedly less
attractive than its outward wrapping, as found by Novemsky and Yale colleague,
Ravi Dhar, since this creates a dissonance between the anticipated and real
worth of a gift.<br /><br />

G. Should all the above advice seem bewildering, then never fear. According to
the 2011 study by Flynn and Francesca Gina, gift recipients are more than happy
to receive cash in place of an actual gift.<br /><br />

Read the text below and answer Questions 22-28.<br /><br />

A. Those who have not entertained the idea that research into family ancestry
might reveal a blue-blooded relative or historical celebrity must be few and far
between. Most of us are intrigued with our origins and if genealogical research
turns up a famous family member on the way, then so much the better.<br /><br />

B. Accordingly, there is a plethora of genealogy websites ready to be accessed
on the internet to satiate the curiosity of those so inclined. Just type in the
name of one of your ancestors into a search engine and you will be immediately
inundated with genealogy sites. Whilst some sites may be free, others will be on
a pay-as-you-go or subscription basis. Often the sheer number of websites can
initially overwhelm the would-be genealogist.<br /><br />

C. So by what criteria do you select a website to aid your research into your
family tree? Whilst free websites may seem the most attractive option, they may
not adequately meet your needs. A feepaying website, however, might provide
access to a wider range of resources, such as birth and death certificates, or
at least indexes to the certificates, as well as census returns. Such resources
and access to them are fundamental to your research.<br /><br />

D. When you access certificates, try to ensure that they are a digitised form of
the original copy, since transcripts are usually poor substitutes for the
original. Whenever possible, opt for the copies of the original thereby
obviating the possibility of human error in copied or miscopied transcripts.<br /><br />

E. Having obtained or accessed, at least, essential documents, you can then
proceed to more specialised websites providing military or employment
information. Before paying for access to such sites, first establish if the site
contains the records you are seeking. You shouldn't have to pay access to the
site to do so.<br /><br />

F. Ideally, find out if there is a contact name or address for whoever is
responsible for the site. A specialist on hand to answer more detailed queries
is always a bonus.<br /><br />

G. Finally, if websites fail to uncover the information you are seeking you can
always try good old-fashioned archives. Not all information is available on
websites, so, sooner or later you will probably find yourself doing research in
an archive anyway. Hopefully, a combination of websites and archives will
deliver the information you require and uncover a fascinating heritage to
boot.<br /><br />

<strong><u>How a Humble Vegetable Changed the World</u></strong
><br /><br />

A. A fashionable adornment, aphrodisiac or cause of fever, leprosy and
widespread famine? The perceived attributes of a humble tuber, otherwise known
as the potato, have certainly varied over historical eras and with shifts in
belief systems. Accordingly, attitudes towards the potato have ranged from
curiosity and acceptance to fear and suspicion and even downright hostility, as
the British population took to the streets in the 18th century to denounce the
tuber in public protests, rallying under the cry ‘No Potatoes, No Popery!’<br /><br />

B. So, why did a humble tuber excite so much suspicion and mistrust? One has but
to look to the roots - if you will pardon the pun - of the controversial crop to
understand how the potato managed to initially incite such distrust in many,
despite saving millions from starvation in later centuries.<br /><br />

C. The potato, together with the eggplant (aubergine) and tomato, originates
from the same family as the deadly belladonna (also known as deadly nightshade)
and equally toxic, henbane. Common to all these plants is the presence of the
lethal toxin solanine, a neurological poison. Ingestion of the toxin may lead to
paralysis and death. In addition, the presence of another toxin, tomatine, in
potatoes is similarly potentially deadly. One might be forgiven in thinking,
therefore, that the potato is not an attractive item to have on the menu. Add to
this the belief that the tuber was thought to be a source of leprosy too, then
it is little wonder that the potato took time to win acceptance in European
circles after its introduction in the 16th century.<br /><br />

D. Obviously, the potatoes we eat today bear little resemblance to the
toxin-laden wild potatoes of Peru from where they originate. There, the potatoes
in their natural form are so toxic that they can only be ingested if accompanied
by clay particles. As far back as the 16th century, Peruvian Indians were
utilising such knowledge, dipping the bitter potatoes in a gravy mix of water
and clay particles. The latter served to absorb excess solanine thereby
rendering the potato edible. Nowadays, centuries of crossbreeding between
species has greatly diluted the toxin and its lethal potential.<br /><br />

E. Today, the potato is hailed as a saviour. A French pharmacist named
Parmentier is to be largely credited with the about-face in attitude towards the
potato as a food source in the 17th century. Prior to this period, public
repugnance towards the vegetable as much as reluctance to use it other than as
cattle fodder prevented its appearance on the dining table. A prior ill-fated
introduction of the tuber by Sir Walter Raleigh to the court of Elizabeth I had
done the tuber no favours: the decision of the queen’s cook to serve up the
plant’s indigestible leaves as opposed to the edible tubers had resulted in
universal indigestion amongst court members on this occasion. Parmentier,
however, turned public opinion regarding the tuber by encouraging its addition
to the menus of Louis XVI’s court. So successful was his personal campaign for
the potato’s introduction that the queen, Marie Antoinette, enthusiastically
adorned her hair with potato flowers, sparking off a fashionable trend amongst
court circles.<br /><br />

F. Parmentier’s intervention on behalf of the humble potato was timely and
without doubt ultimately saved millions from starvation. Public acceptance of
the potato, however, initially lagged significantly behind that of court
circles. In fact, it took an edict from the Paris Faculty of Medicine in 1772,
verifying that potatoes were edible, in addition to the famine of 1785 to bring
the public around. Thereafter, the potato became a staple in the diet of the
rich and the poor alike.<br /><br />

G. So significant a role is the potato thought to have played in world history,
with regard to staving off famine and aiding population increase, that historian
W.H. McNeill has attributed the building of empires to the humble tuber. The
potato, he argues, fuelled the rise of the West between 1750 and 1950 as
European nations became no longer beholden to famine and were able to take
dominion over other countries.<br /><br />

H. The rise of the potato from maligned tuber to worldwide food source, becoming
the fifth most important crop globally after wheat, corn, rice and sugar cane,
also had its downside. The over-dependence of European countries on the potato,
arising in a virtual monoculture, led to the Irish Famine and mass emigration
when crops failed in 1845. Subsequently, increased knowledge of pesticides and
more stringent controls over crop production have largely warded off the
significant crop failures that were so devastating in the past.<br /><br />

The potato polarised public opinion from the outset. Whilst the potato won
<input name="q36" type="text" style="width: 100px" />
with some, others reacted with extreme actions of prejudice.<br /><br />

Unwillingness to accept the potato was perfectly understandable. Coming from the
same family as its deadlier counterparts, belladonna and henbane, the potato was

whilst others were forced to migrate en masse in order to survive.<br /><br />
