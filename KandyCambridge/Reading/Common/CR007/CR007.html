  <h3>Reading Lesson 7: Classification Type</h3>
  <h4><b>Why do we sleep?</b></h4>
  <p>
    Researchers have found that sleep is beneficial to humans in many ways: it
    helps us process memories, and keeps our social and emotional lives on
    track. Yet we still do not really know how, why or even exactly when sleep
    evolved.
  </p>
  <p>
    “The cost of losing consciousness to survival is astronomical,” says Matthew
    Walker at the University of California in Berkeley. Whatever functions sleep
    performs, they must be so fundamentally important that they far outweigh the
    obvious vulnerability associated with being asleep. This means we can
    confidently reject one of the simplest theories of sleep: that we drift off
    simply because we have nothing better to do. This could be described as the
    indolence theory of sleep. Once an animal has eaten, seen off any rivals and
    exhausted any potential mating opportunities, it effectively has an empty
    schedule, and losing consciousness kills time for a few hours. It is a fun
    idea, but considering that a sleeping animal is significantly more likely to
    be caught and eaten than a waking animal, this hypothesis makes “zero
    sense”, says Walker. There is now an emerging consensus on the behavioural
    features that define sleep, and these features can be used to look for sleep
    in simple animals, says Ravi Allada at Northwestern University in Evanston,
    Illinois.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are three main elements, says Allada. First and foremost, sleep
    renders an animal quiet and still: muscles are not very active during sleep.
    Second, sleep makes animals slower to respond. For instance, if you make a
    loud noise near a sleeping animal, it will react more slowly than an awake
    animal. And finally, we can recognise sleep because it keeps animals from
    getting tired.
  </p>
  <p>
    “I believe that the behavioural features used to characterise sleep are
    quite reliable for identifying this behaviour in animals… and to
    differentiate sleep from a simple rest,” says Paul-Antoine Libourel at the
    Lyon Neuroscience Research Center in France.
  </p>
  <p>
    According to Libourel, sleep now appears to be an almost universal feature
    of animal life. “This suggests that sleep is fundamental for the survival of
    species. Natural selection did not suppress it. In fact, natural selection
    did the exact opposite: it built on the concept of sleep, adding in new
    stages and new functions.”
  </p>
  <p>
    “At some point in prehistory, the most famous of all stages of sleep
    appeared: rapid eye movement (REM) sleep,” says Walker. “Non-REM sleep was
    the original form.” Sleep impacts every major system in the body. Cut down
    on sleep and it is not just your brain that struggles: the reproductive,
    metabolic, cardiovascular, thermoregulatory and immune systems all suffer
    too, says Libourel. All the explanations for sleep we have looked at
    ultimately boil down to the same thing: sleep is a state we enter to fix the
    systems that are put under stress when we are awake.
