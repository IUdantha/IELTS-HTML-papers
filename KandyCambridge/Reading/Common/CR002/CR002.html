  <h4><b>Australian Agricultural Innovations 1850 – 1900</b></h4>
  <p>
    During this period, there was a wide spread expansion of agriculture in
    Australia. The selection system was begun, whereby small sections of land
    were parceled out by lot. Particularly in New South Wales, this led to
    conflicts between small holders and the emerging squatter class, whose abuse
    of the system often allowed them to take vast tracts of fertile land.
  </p>
  <p>
    There were also many positive advances in farming technology as the farmers
    adapted agricultural methods to the harsh Australian conditions. One of the
    most important was “dry farming”. This was the discovery that repeated
    ploughing of fallow, unproductive land could preserve nitrates and moisture,
    allowing the land to eventually be cultivated. This, along with the
    extension of the railways allowed the development of what are now great
    inland wheat lands.
  </p>
  <p>
    The inland areas of Australia are less fertile than most other wheat
    producing countries and yields per acre are lower. This slowed their
    development, but also led to the development of several labour saving
    devices. In 1843 John Ridley, a South Australian farmer, invented “the
    stripper”, a basic harvesting machine. By the 1860s its use was widespread.
    H. V. McKay, then only nineteen, modified the machine so that it was a
    complete harvester: cutting, collecting and sorting. McKay developed this
    early innovation into a large harvester manufacturing industry centred near
    Melbourne and exporting worldwide. Robert Bowyer Smith invented the “stump
    jump plough”, which let a farmer plough land which still had tree stumps on
    it. It did this by replacing the traditional plough shear with a set of
    wheels that could go over stumps, if necessary.
  </p>
  <p>
    The developments in farm machinery were supported by scientific research.
    During the late 19th century, South Australian wheat yields were going down.
    An agricultural scientist at the colony’s agricultural college, John
    Custance, found that this was due to a lack of phosphates and advised the
    use of soluble superphosphate fertilizer. The implementation of this scheme
    revitalised the industry.
  </p>
  <p>
    From early days it had been obvious that English and European sheep breeds
    had to be adapted to Australian conditions, but only near the end of the
    century was the same applied to crops. Prior to this, English and South
    African strains had been use, with varying degrees of success. William
    Farrer, from Cambridge University, was the first to develop new wheat
    varieties that were better able to withstand dry Australian conditions. By
    1914, Australia was no longer thought of as a land suitable only for sheep,
    but as a wheat growing nation.
