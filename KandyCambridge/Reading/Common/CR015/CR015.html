    You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 1-13, which are based on
    Reading Passage 1 below.
  </p>
  <h4><b>Children’s Literature</b></h4>
  <p>
    Stories and poems aimed at children have an exceedingly long
    history:lullabies, for example, were sung in Roman times, and a few nursery
    games and rhymes are almost as ancient. Yet so far as written-down
    literature is concerned, while there were stories in print before 1700 that
    children often seized on when they had the chance, such as translations of
    Aesop’s fables, fairy-stories and popular ballads and romances, these were
    not aimed at young people in particular. Since the only genuinely
    child-oriented literature at this time would have been a few instructional
    works to help with reading and general knowledge, plus the odd Puritanical
    tract as an aid to morality, the only course for keen child readers was to
    read adult literature. This still occurs today, especially with adult
    thrillers or romances that include more exciting, graphic detail than is
    normally found in the literature for younger readers.
  </p>
  <p>
    By the middle of the 18th century there were enough eager child readers, and
    enough parents glad to cater to this interest, for publishers to specialize
    in children’s books whose first aim was pleasure rather than education or
    morality. In Britain, a London merchant named Thomas Boreham produced
    Cajanus, The Swedish Giant in 1742, while the more famous John Newbery
    published A Little Pretty Pocket Book in 1744.1ts contents—rhymes, stories,
    children’s games plus a free gift (‘A ball and a pincushion’)——in many ways
    anticipated the similar lucky-dip contents of children’s annuals this
    century. It is a tribute to Newbery’s flair that he hit upon a winning
    formula quite so quickly, to be pirated almost immediately in
    America.ieltsxpress small logo

  <p>
    Such pleasing levity was not to last. Influenced by Rousseau, whose
    Emile(1762) decreed that all books for children save Robinson Crusoe were a
    dangerous diversion, contemporary critics saw to it that children’s
    literature should be instructive and uplifting. Prominent among such voices
    was Mrs. Sarah Trimmer, whose magazine The Guardian of Education (1802)
    carried the first regular reviews of children’s books. It was she who
    condemned fairy-tales for their violence and general absurdity; her own
    stories, Fabulous Histories (1786) described talking animals who were always
    models of sense and decorum.
  </p>
  <p>
    So the moral story for children was always threatened from within, given the
    way children have of drawing out entertainment from the sternest moralist.
    But the greatest blow to the improving children’s book was to come from an
    unlikely source indeed: early 19th century interest in folklore. Both
    nursery rhymes, selected by James Orchard Halliwell for a folklore society
    in 1842, and collection of fairy-stories by the scholarly Grimm brothers,
    swiftly translated into English in 1823,soon rocket to popularity with the
    young, quickly leading to new editions, each one more child-centered than
    the last. From now on younger children could expect stories written for
    their particular interest and with the needs of their own limited experience
    of life kept well to the fore.
  </p>
  <p>
    What eventually determined the reading of older children was often not the
    availability of special children’s literature as such but access to books
    that contained characters, such as young people or animals, with whom they
    could more easily empathize, or action, such as exploring or fighting, that
    made few demands on adult maturity or understanding.The final apotheosis of
    literary childhood as something to be protected from unpleasant reality came
    with the arrival in the late 1930s of child-centered best-sellers intend on
    entertainment at its most escapist. In Britain novelist such as Enid Blyton
    and Richmal Crompton described children who were always free to have the
    most unlikely adventures, secure in the knowledge that nothing bad could
    ever happen to them in the end. The fact that war broke out again during her
    books’ greatest popularity fails to register at all in the self-enclosed
    world inhabited by Enid Blyton’s young characters. Reaction against such
    dream-worlds was inevitable after World War II, coinciding with the growth
    of paperback sales, children’s libraries and a new spirit of moral and
    social concern. Urged on by committed publishers and progressive librarians,
    writers slowly began to explore new areas of interest while also shifting
    the settings of their plots from the middle-class world to which their
    chiefly adult patrons had always previously belonged. ieltsxpress small logo
  </p>
  <p>
    Critical emphasis, during this development, has been divided. For some the
    most important task was to rid children’s books of the social prejudice and
    exclusiveness no longer found acceptable. Others concentrated more on the
    positive achievements of contemporary children’s literature. That writers of
    these works are now often recommended to the attentions of adult as well as
    child readers echoes the 19th-century belief that children’s literature can
    be shared by the generations, rather than being a defensive barrier between
    childhood and the necessary growth towards adult understanding.
