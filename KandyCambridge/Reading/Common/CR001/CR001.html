  <h3>Reading Lesson 1: Matching Paragraph Headings</h3>
  <h4><b>Yoruba Town</b></h4>
  <p>
    <b>A.</b> The Yoruba people of Nigeria classify their towns in two ways.
    Permanent towns with their own governments are called “ilu”, whereas
    temporary settlements, set up to support work in the country are “aba”.
    Although ilu tend to be larger than aba, the distinction is not one of size,
    some aba are large, while declining ilu can be small, but of purpose. There
    is no “typical” Yoruba town, but some features are common to most towns.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>B.</b> In the 19th century most towns were heavily fortified and the
    foundations of these walls are sometimes visible. Collecting tolls to enter
    and exit through the walls was a major source of revenue for the old town
    rulers, as were market fees. The markets were generally located centrally
    and in small towns, while in large towns there were permanent stands made of
    corrugated iron or concrete. The market was usually next to the local
    ruler’s palace.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>C.</b> The palaces were often very large. In the 1930’s, the area of
    Oyo’s palace covered 17 acres, and consisted of a series of courtyards
    surrounded by private and public rooms. After colonisation, many of the
    palaces were completely or partially demolished. Often the rulers built two
    storey houses for themselves using some of the palace grounds for government
    buildings.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>D.</b> The town is divided into different sections. In some towns these
    are regular, extending out from the center of the town like spokes on a
    wheel, while in others, where space is limited, they are more random. The
    different areas are further divided into compounds called “ile”. These vary
    in size considerably from single dwellings to up to thirty houses. They tend
    to be larger in the North. Large areas are devoted to government
    administrative buildings. Newer developments such as industrial or
    commercial areas or apartment housing for civil servants tends to be built
    on the edge of the town.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>E.</b> Houses are rectangular and either have a courtyard in the center
    or the rooms come off a central corridor. Most social life occurs in the
    courtyard. They are usually built of hardened mud and have roofs of
    corrugated iron or, in the countryside, thatch. Buildings of this material
    are easy to alter, either by knocking down rooms or adding new ones. And can
    be improved by coating the walls with cement. Richer people often build
    their houses of concrete blocks and, if they can afford to, build two storey
    houses. Within compounds there can be quite a mixture of building types.
    Younger well-educated people may have well furnished houses while their
    older relatives live in mud walled buildings and sleep on mats on the floor.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>F.</b> The builder or the most senior man gets a room either near the
    entrance or, in a two storied house, next to the balcony. He usually has
    more than one room. Junior men get a room each and there are separate rooms
    for teenage boys and girls to sleep in. Younger children sleep with their
    mothers. Any empty room are used as storage, let out or, if they face the
    street, used as shops.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>G.</b> Amenities vary. In some towns most of the population uses communal
    water taps and only the rich have piped water, in others piped water is more
    normal. Some areas have toilets, but bucket toilets are common with waste
    being collected by a “night soil man”. Access to water and electricity are
    key political issues.
