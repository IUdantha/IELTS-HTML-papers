  <h4><b>Emojis</b></h4>

  <p>
    <b>A.</b> Language always changes, of course. This is one of the few
    constants about it. But it's arguably changing at a faster rate now than at
    any previous moment in its history. And emojis - the set of picture
    characters that people use to punctuate their online correspondence - are at
    the forefront of this frenzy for change. <br /><br />
    As a form of global communication, emojis only began their growth in 2011.
    Four years later, it was estimated that they were being used by over 90 per
    cent of the online population. In excess of six billion were being sent
    every day. Their prevalence in the culture was such that Oxford Dictionaries
    recently chose one as their word of the year. 'Words of the Year' are those
    judged to be reflective of the 'ethos, mood, or preoccupations of that
    particular year'. They're very much of their time. And often, once that time
    has passed, they fade from people's consciousness almost as quickly as they
    arose.
    <br /><br />
    There's a good chance, then, that the emoji chosen by Oxford Dictionaries –
    the 'face with tears of joy' - will also appear to be dated in a few years.
    But the reasons for this offer a fascinating insight into the way that
    society is evolving. The little yellow circle with dots for eyes acts as a
    surprisingly good lens through which to view the history of human
    communication, and to predict its future.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>B. </b> There are two main reasons why language changes. One is to do
    with the way that language mirrors the changes in how we relate to each
    other. As an expression of identity, language is adapted by different groups
    and different generations to reflect their own sense of self. It also needs
    to constantly assimilate fresh concepts as these evolve. <br /><br />
    Words are being created for these reasons all the time. But what's
    interesting about emojis is that they've contributed to this ever-expanding
    storehouse in a different way. At this point in our history, the gaps in our
    vocabulary are being filled not simply by new words, but by an absolutely
    new system of expression.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>C. </b> The second major reason that language changes is down to
    technology - specifically, the ways in which the technologies we use have an
    effect on the process of communication itself. Both hardware and new
    technologies result in us subtly changing the way we interact with each
    other and also altering the shape of the language we use. <br /><br />
    Emojis have evolved as a solution to the needs of mobile communication. In
    particular, they compensate for the way that computer- mediated messaging on
    smartphones can sometimes tend towards the emotionally empty. Whereas
    face-to-face ,or even voice- to voice, conversations can ex press e motional
    closeness through facial expression or tone of voice, this is easy to miss
    when messages are rendered in a few short words on a small screen. Emojis
    are a means of restoring this emotional framing to an interaction -
    punctuating your message with a smile.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>D. </b> But unlike almost any other type of language system, emojis have
    something akin to a built- in obsolescence. Just as smartphones and their
    operating systems have a frequent refresh rate, emojis also get routine
    enhancements. The emojis you have on your phone now will undergo subtle
    redesigns over the course of time, and extra characters will be added.
    Because of this, their usefulness is artificially limited. <br /><br />
    In the context of communication systems, this is something that's never
    previously been the case. Twenty years ago, people might have bought a new
    landline phone when they were tired of the design of their old phone or if
    they wanted to get one with whatever latest innovation was going around - an
    inbuilt answering machine, say. But they didn't have to upgrade the language
    they were using as well.
    <br /><br />
    Emojis, on the other hand, are a case study of how technology and the human
    capacity for communication are working together - of how the onward march of
    technology exists at the intersection of consumerism, innovation and design.
    Moreover, the fact that they 're at the front line of a relentless wave of
    technologically driven change in communications practices encourages - if
    not necessitates - a great amount of creativity in the way they're used.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>E. </b> Finally, there's the way they've become implicated in almost all
    aspects of modern society, from politics and marketing to art and
    entertainment. Emojis are the subject of musicals and Hollywood films.
    They're the inspiration for fashion design, art and architecture. They're a
    staple in advertising and commerce. Understanding why they've become so
    popular, and how they work, can not only explain something about the nature
    of language; it can also help us to understand our relationship with
    technology, society and ourselves .

  <h4>The importance of the 'face with tears of joy'</h4>
  <p>
    It is probable that before long, an emoji such as the 'face with tears of
    joy' will seem<br />
    <strong>33</strong> <input type="text" name="q33" style="width: 150px" />.
    This is of interest as it tells us about developments in<br />
    <strong>34</strong> <input type="text" name="q34" style="width: 150px" />,
    providing an effective way to focus on both the<br />
    <strong>35</strong>
    <input type="text" name="q35" style="width: 150px" /> and the future of
    human communication.<br /><br />

    Changes in language reflect changes in people's relationships. They reflect
    the ways in<br />
    which the <strong>36</strong>
    <input type="text" name="q36" style="width: 150px" /> of groups and
    generations changes over time, and they<br />
    allow new <strong>37</strong>
    <input type="text" name="q37" style="width: 150px" /> to be included.
    However, emojis are interesting as<br />
    they are a system that expresses these ideas in a completely new way.
