  <h3>Reading test Section 02: activity 03</h3>
  <p>
    You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 14–26, which are based on the
    reading passage below.
  </p>
  <h4><b>Driverless cars</b></h4>
  <p>
    <b>A.</b> The automotive sector is well used to adapting to automation in
    manufacturing. The implementation of robotic car manufacture from the 1970s
    onwards led to significant cost savings and improvements in the reliability
    and flexibility of vehicle mass production. A new challenge to vehicle
    production is now on the horizon and, again, it comes from automation.
    However, this time it is not to do with the manufacturing process, but with
    the vehicles themselves.<br />

    Research projects on vehicle automation are not new. Vehicles with limited
    self-driving capabilities have been around for more than 50 years, resulting
    in significant contributions towards driver assistance systems. But since
    Google announced in 2010 that it had been trialling self-driving cars on the
    streets of California, progress in this field has quickly gathered pace.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>B.</b> There are many reasons why technology is advancing so fast. One
    frequently cited motive is safety; indeed, research at the UK’s Transport
    Research Laboratory has demonstrated that more than 90 percent of road
    collisions involve human error as a contributory factor, and it is the
    primary cause in the vast majority. Automation may help to reduce the
    incidence of this.
    <br />
    Another aim is to free the time people spend driving for other purposes. If
    the vehicle can do some or all of the driving, it may be possible to be
    productive, to socialise or simply to relax while automation systems have
    responsibility for safe control of the vehicle. If the vehicle can do the
    driving, those who are challenged by existing mobility models – such as
    older or disabled travellers – may be able to enjoy significantly greater
    travel autonomy.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>C.</b> Beyond these direct benefits, we can consider the wider
    implications for transport and society, and how manufacturing processes
    might need to respond as a result. At present, the average car spends more
    than 90 percent of its life parked. Automation means that initiatives for
    car-sharing become much more viable, particularly in urban areas with
    significant travel demand. If a significant proportion of the population
    choose to use shared automated vehicles, mobility demand can be met by far
    fewer vehicles.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>D.</b> The Massachusetts Institute of Technology investigated automated
    mobility in Singapore, finding that fewer than 30 percent of the vehicles
    currently used would be required if fully automated car sharing could be
    implemented. If this is the case, it might mean that we need to manufacture
    far fewer vehicles to meet demand. However, the number of trips being taken
    would probably increase, partly because empty vehicles would have to be
    moved from one customer to the next.
    <br />
    Modelling work by the University of Michigan Transportation Research
    Institute suggests automated vehicles might reduce vehicle ownership by 43
    percent, but that vehicles’ average annual mileage double as a result. As a
    consequence, each vehicle would be used more intensively, and might need
    replacing sooner. This faster rate of turnover may mean that vehicle
    production will not necessarily decrease
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>E.</b> Automation may prompt other changes in vehicle manufacture. If we
    move to a model where consumers are tending not to own a single vehicle but
    to purchase access to a range of vehicle through a mobility provider,
    drivers will have the freedom to select one that best suits their needs for
    a particular journey, rather than making a compromise across all their
    requirements. <br />Since, for most of the time, most of the seats in most
    cars are unoccupied, this may boost production of a smaller, more efficient
    range of vehicles that suit the needs of individuals. Specialised vehicles
    may then be available for exceptional journeys, such as going on a family
    camping trip or helping a son or daughter move to university.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>F.</b> There are a number of hurdles to overcome in delivering automated
    vehicles to our roads. These include the technical difficulties in ensuring
    that the vehicle works reliably in the infinite range of traffic, weather
    and road situations it might encounter; the regulatory challenges in
    understanding how liability and enforcement might change when drivers are no
    longer essential for vehicle operation; and the societal changes that may be
    required for communities to trust and accept automated vehicles as being a
    valuable part of the mobility landscape.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>G.</b> It’s clear that there are many challenges that need to be
    addressed but, through robust and targeted research, these can most probably
    be conquered within the next 10 years. Mobility will change in such
    potentially significant ways and in association with so many other
    technological developments, such as telepresence and virtual reality, that
    it is hard to make concrete predictions about the future. However, one thing
    is certain: change is coming, and the need to be flexible in response to
    this will be vital for those involved in manufacturing the vehicles that
    will deliver future mobility.

  <h4>Questions 19–22:</h4>
  <p>
    Complete the summary below.<br />
    Choose <strong>NO MORE THAN TWO WORDS</strong> from the passage for each
    answer.<br />
    Write your answers in boxes 19–22 on your answer sheet.
  </p>

  <p><strong>The impact of driverless cars</strong></p>
  <p>
    Figures from the Transport Research Laboratory indicate that most motor
    accidents are partly due to
    <input type="text" name="q19" placeholder="19" style="width: 150px" />, so
    the introduction of driverless vehicles will result in greater safety. In
    addition to the direct benefits of automation, it may bring other
    advantages. For example, schemes for
    <input type="text" name="q20" placeholder="20" style="width: 150px" />
    will be more workable, especially in towns and cities, resulting in fewer
    cars on the road.
  </p>
  <p>
    According to the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute,
    there could be a 43 percent drop in
    <input type="text" name="q21" placeholder="21" style="width: 150px" />
    of cars. However, this would mean that the yearly
    <input type="text" name="q22" placeholder="22" style="width: 150px" />
    of each car would, on average, be twice as high as it currently is.
  </p>
