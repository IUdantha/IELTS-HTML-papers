  <p>Read the passage below and answer Questions 1-7.</p>
  <h4><b>The Young Person's Railcard</b></h4>
  <p>
    A Young Person's Railcard gives young people the opportunity to purchase
    discounted rail tickets across Britain. Just imagine where it could take you
    - to festivals, to see distant friends or to London for a weekend break.
  </p>
  <p><b>Who can apply?</b></p>
  <p>
    Absolutely anybody between 16 and 25 can apply. You will need to provide
    proof that you are under 26 years of age. For this, only your birth
    certificate, driving licence, passport or medical card will be acceptable.
    Alternatively, if you are a mature student over this age but in full-time
    education, you can also apply. In order to prove your eligibility, you will
    need to get your head teacher, tutor, or head of department to sign the
    application form as well as one of your photos, the latter also needing to
    be officially stamped. 'Full-time education' is defined as over 15 hours per
    week for at least 20 weeks a year. Then go along to any major railway
    station, rail-appointed travel agent or authorised student travel office
    with your completed application form from this leaflet, together with £28,
    two passport-sized photos and proof of eligibility.
  </p>
  <p><b>Using your railcard</b></p>
  <p>
    You can use it at any time - weekends, Bank Holidays or during the week. But
    if you travel before 10 am Monday to Friday (except during July and August)
    minimum fares will apply. For full details of these, please ask at your
    local station or contact a rail-appointed travel agent.
  </p>
  <p><b>Conditions</b></p>
  <p>
    In cases where a railcard does not bear the user's signature, it will be
    treated as invalid. Neither your railcard nor any tickets bought with it may
    be used by anybody else. Unless there are no purchase facilities available
    at the station where you began your journey, you will be required to pay the
    full fare if you are unable to produce a valid ticket for inspection during
    a journey.
  </p>
  <p>
    Reduced rate tickets are not available for first-class travel or for
    Eurostar links to France and Belgium. Passengers will be charged the full
    rate if they want to use these services.
