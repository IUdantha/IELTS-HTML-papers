  <h4><b>FORMAL DRESS CODE FOR COMPANY EMPLOYEES</b></h4>
  <p>
    At Transit European, the company’s objective in establishing a formal dress
    code is to enable our employees to project the professional image that is in
    keeping with the needs of our clients and customers who seek our guidance,
    input, and professional services. Because our industry requires the
    appearance of trusted business professionals and we serve clients at our
    site on a daily basis, a more formal dress code is necessary for our
    employees.
  </p>
  <p><b>Formal Dress Code Guidelines</b></p>
  <p>
    In a formal business environment, the standard of dressing for men and women
    is a suit. Alternatively, a jacket may be worn with appropriate accessories.
    Torn, dirty, or frayed clothing is unacceptable. Clothing should be pressed
    and never wrinkled. No dress code can cover all contingencies so employees
    must exert a certain amount of judgement in their choice of clothing to wear
    to work. If you experience uncertainty, please ask your supervisor for
    advice.
  </p>
  <p><b>Shoes and Footwear</b></p>
  <p>
    Conservative walking shoes, dress shoes, loafers, boots, flats, dress heels,
    and backless shoes are acceptable for work. Not wearing stockings or socks
    is inappropriate. Tennis shoes and any shoe with an open toe are not
    acceptable in the office.
  </p>
  <p><b>Accessories and Jewellery</b></p>
  <p>
    The wearing of ties, scarves, belts, and jewellery is encouraged, provided
    they are tasteful. Items which are flashy should be avoided.
  </p>

  <p><b>Makeup, Perfume, and Cologne</b></p>

  <p>
    A professional appearance is encouraged and excessive makeup is
    unprofessional. Remember that some employees may have allergic reactions to
    the chemicals in perfumes and makeup, so wear these substances in
    moderation.
  </p>

  <p><b>Hats and Head Covering</b></p>

  <p>
    Hats are not appropriate in the office. Head covers that are required for
    reasons of faith or to honour cultural tradition are permitted.
  </p>

  <p><b>Dress Down Days</b></p>

  <p>
    Certain days can be declared dress down days, generally Fridays. On these
    days, business casual clothing is allowed. Clothing that has our company
    logo is strongly encouraged. Sports team, university, and fashion brand
    names on clothing are generally acceptable. However, you may wish to keep a
    jacket in your office in case a client unexpectedly appears.
  </p>

  <p><b>Violation of Dress Code</b></p>

  <p>
    If clothing fails to meet these standards, as determined by the employee’s
    supervisor, the employee will be asked not to wear the inappropriate item to
    work again. If the problem persists, the employee will receive a verbal
    warning and may be sent home to change clothes.
