  <p>
    You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 14-26, which are based on the
    Reading Passage below.
  </p>
  <h4><b>Tidal Power</b></h4>
  <p>
    Undersea turbines which produce electricity from the tides are set to become
    an important source of renewable energy for Britain. It is still too early
    to predict the extent of the impact they may have. but all the signs are
    that they will play a significant role in the future.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>A.</b> Operating on the same principle as wind turbines, the power in sea
    turbines comes from tidal currents which turn blades similar to ships'
    propellers, but, unlike the wind, the tides are predictable and the power
    input is constant. The technology raises the prospect of Britain becoming
    self-sufficient in renewable energy and drastically reducing its carbon
    dioxide emissions, if tide, wind and wave power are all developed. Britain
    would be able to close gas, coal and nuclear power plants and export
    renewable power to other parts of Europe. Unlike wind power which Britain
    originally developed and then abandoned for 20 years allowing the Dutch to
    make it a major industry, undersea turbines could become a big export earner
    to island nations such as Japan and New Zealand.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>B. </b> Tidal sites have already been identified that will produce
    one-sixth or more of the UK’s power - and at prices competitive with modern
    gas turbines and undercutting those of the already ailing nuclear industry.
    One site alone, the Pendand Firth, between Orkney and mainland Scotland,
    could produce 10% of the country's electricity with banks of turbines under
    the sea, and another at Alderney in the Channel islands three times the
    1,200 megawatts of Britain's largest and newest nuclear plant, Sizewell B,
    in Suffolk. Other sites identified include the Bristol Channel and the west
    coast of Scotland, particularly the channel between Campbeltown and Northern
    Ireland.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>C. </b> Work on designs for the new turbine blades and sites are well
    advanced at the University of Southampton‘s sustainable energy research
    group. The first station is expected to be installed off Lynmouth in Devon
    shortly to test the technology in a venture jointly funded by the department
    of Trade and Industry and the European Union. AbuBakr Bahaj, in charge of
    the Southampton research, said: 'The prospects for energy from tidal
    currents are far better than from wind because the flows of water are
    predictable and constant. The technology for dealing with the hostile saline
    environment under the sea has been developed in the North Sea oil industry
    and much is already known about turbine blade design, because of wind power
    and ship propellers. There are a few technical difficulties, but I believe
    in the next nine to ten years we will be installing commercial marine
    turbine farms'. Southampton has been awarded £215,000 over three years to
    develop the turbines and is working with Marine Current Turbines. a
    subsidiary of IT power; on the Lynmouth project. EU research has now
    identified 106 potential sites for tidal power, 80% round the coasts of
    Britain. The best sites are between islands or around heavily indented
    coasts where there are strong tidal currents.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>D. </b> A marine turbine blade needs to be only one-third of the size of
    a wind generator to produce three times as much power. The blades will be
    about 20 metres in diameter so around 30 metres of water is required. Unlike
    wind power, there are unlikely to be environmental objections. Fish and
    other creatures are thought unlikely to be at risk from the relatively slow
    turning blades. Each turbine will be mounted on a tower which will connect
    to the national power supply grid via underwater cables. The towers will
    stick out of the water and be lit. to warn shipping, and also be designed to
    be lifted out of the water for maintenance and to clean seaweed from the
    blades.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>E. </b> Dr Baha has done most work on the Alderrney site, where there are
    powerful currents. The single undersea turbine farm would produce far more
    power than needed for the Channel Islands and most would be fed into the
    French Grid and be re-imported into Britain via the cable under the Channel.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>F.</b> One technical difficulty is cavitation, where low pressure behind
    a turning blade causes air bubbles. These can cause vibration and damage the
    blades of the turbines. Dr Bahaj said: 'We have to test a number of blade
    types to avoid this happening or at least make sure it does not damage the
    turbines or reduce performance. Another slight concern is submerged debris
    floating into the blades. So far we do not know how much of a problem it
    might be. We will have to make the turbines robust because the sea is a
    hostile environment, but all the signs that we can do it are good.
