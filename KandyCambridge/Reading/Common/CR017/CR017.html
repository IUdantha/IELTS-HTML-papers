  <h4><b>OUT OF THE ASHES</b></h4>

  <p>
    <b>A.</b> On the afternoon of 30th August 1989, fire broke out at Uppark, a
    large eighteenth-century house in Sussex. For a year builders had been
    replacing the lead on the roof, and by a stroke of irony, were due to finish
    the next day, on August 31st. Within fifteen minutes of the alarm being
    sounded, the fire brigade had arrived on the scene, though nothing was to
    survive of the priceless collection on the first floor apart from an oil
    painting of a dog which the firemen swept up as they finally retreated from
    the blaze. But due to the courage and swift action of the previous owners,
    the Meade-Featherstonhaugh family, and the staff, stewards and visitors to
    the house, who formed human chains to pass the precious pieces of porcelain,
    furniture and paintings out on to the lawn, 95 per cent of the contents from
    the ground floor and the basement were saved. As the fire continued to rage,
    the National Trust’s conservators were being mobilised, and that evening
    local stationers were especially opened to provide the bulk supplies of
    blotting paper so desperately needed in the salvage operation.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>B. </b> The following morning, Uppark stood open to the sky. A sludge of
    wet charcoal covered the ground floor and basement, and in every room
    charred and fallen timbers lay amongst the smoke. It was a scene of utter
    devastation.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>C. </b> After the initial sense of shock, the days which followed the
    fire were filled with discoveries. Helped by volunteers, the National
    Trust’s archaeologists and conservators swung into action, first of all
    marking the site out into a grid and then salvaging everything down to the
    last door handle. The position of each fragment was recorded, and all the
    debris was stored in countless dustbins before being shifted and
    categorised.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>D. </b> There was great excitement as remnants of the lantern from the
    Staircase Hall were pulled out from the debris of two fallen floors, and
    also three weeks later when the Red Room carpet, thought to have been
    totally lost, was found wrapped around the remains of a piano. There was a
    lucky reprieve for the State Bed too. Staff who had left the scene at 3 am
    on the night of the fire had thought its loss was inevitable, but when they
    returned the next morning it had escaped largely undamaged. Firemen,
    directed by the National Trust’s conservators from outside the Tapestry Room
    window, dismantled the silk-hung bed and passed it out piece by piece.
    Twenty minutes later the ceiling fell in.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>E. </b> The scale of the task to repair Uppark was unprecedented in the
    National Trust. The immediate question was whether it should be done at all.
    A decision had to be whatever had not been damaged by the fire was exposed
    to the elements. Within a month, after consulting many experts and with the
    agreement of the National Trust’s Executive Committee, the restoration
    programme began. It was undertaken for three main reasons. After the fire it
    had become apparent just how much remained of the structure with its
    splendidly decorated interiors; to have pulled the house down, as one
    commentator suggested, would have been vandalism. Also, the property was
    covered by insurance, so the repairs would not call upon the National
    Trust’s own funds. Lastly, much had been saved of the fine collection
    acquired especially for Uppark from 1747 by Sir Matthew Featherstonhaugh and
    his son Harry. These objects belonged nowhere else, and complete restoration
    of the house would allow them to be seen and enjoyed again in their original
    setting.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>F.</b> The search for craftsmen and women capable of doing the intricate
    restoration work was nation-wide. Once the quality and skill of the
    individual or company had been ascertained, they had to pass an economic
    test, as every job was competitively tendered. This has had enormous
    benefits because not only have a number of highly skilled people come to the
    fore – woodcarvers for example, following in the footsteps of Grinling
    Gibbons – but many of them, for example, plasterers, have relearnt the
    skills of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries which can now be of use
    to other country house owners when the need arises.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>G.</b> In June 1994 the building programme was completed, on time and on
    budget. The total cost of the work to repair the house and its contents came
    to be nearly £20 million, largely met from insurance. In addition, it made
    economic sense for the National Trust to invest time and money in upgrading
    water and heating systems, installing modern environmental controls, and
    updating fire and security equipment.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>H.</b> The final stages of restoration and the massive programme of
    reinstallation took eight months. The family and the room stewards were
    visibly moved when returning to their old haunts, perhaps the best testament
    that the spirit of Uppark had not died. But the debate will no doubt
    continue as to whether or not it was right to repair the house after the
    fire. The National Trust has done its best to remain true to Uppark; it is
    for others to judge the success of the project.
  </p>

    Note: The National Trust is a charitable organisation in Britain set up over
    a hundred years ago to preserve the national heritage.
