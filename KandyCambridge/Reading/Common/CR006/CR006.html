  <h3>Reading Lesson 6: Matching Information to Paragraphs</h3>
  <h4><b>The lost giants of Australian fauna</b></h4>
  <p>
    <b>A.</b> Australia's wildlife is unique. The vast majority of the animals
    that live there are not found anywhere else – and things were no different 1
    million years ago during the Pleistocene: the age of the super-sized mammal.
    Before humanity became Earth's undisputed superpower, giant beasts of all
    shapes and sizes dominated every continent, but the Pleistocene mammals of
    Australia were different. Some of them could grow to the size of small cars,
    or possessed teeth longer than knife blades.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>B.</b> None of these animals survive today – although exactly why that's
    the case is a mystery. Humans, with their advanced hunting techniques and
    use of fire to modify the landscape, may have played a central role in the
    megafauna's disappearance, but this idea is still a matter of heated debate.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>C.</b> Even if we cannot be sure that the arrival of Australian
    Aboriginals on the continent had catastrophic effects on its native animals,
    it seems that the animals had a rather spiritual effect on the humans. The
    Aboriginal mythological "Dreamtime" includes a cast of monstrous creatures,
    many of which bear a close resemblance to some of the real-life monsters
    that once stalked Australia's plains. Are the myths based in fact? Perhaps:
    after all, these creatures are far stranger than anything dreamed up by
    humans.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>D.</b> For instance, the two-tonnes weighting Diprotodon comfortably
    holds the title of largest marsupial ever. In size and appearance it looked
    superficially like a modern rhinoceros, but the Diprotodon seems to have had
    a social lifestyle more like that of an elephant, another mammal with which
    it shares anatomical similarities. What the Diprotodon most resembles,
    however, is exactly what it is: an enormous wombat.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>E.</b> Another record breaker, this time a world champion; Varanus
    priscus, commonly known by its antiquated genus name Megalania – was the
    largest terrestrial lizard the world has ever known. Megalania was a goanna
    lizard, a relative of today's infamous Komodo dragon, and conservative
    estimates have predicted that it was at least 5.5m long.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>F.</b> These monster marsupials were not the only giants. Their numbers
    were swelled by half-tonne birds and dinosaur-like tortoises. Although this
    biological assemblage was truly nightmarish for humans, it greatly enriched
    the Australia’s fauna and contributed to the world’s biological diversity.
    Unfortunately, all of these species are extinct nowadays. This fact shows us
    that even strong, monstrous creatures can easily die out. So we need to care
    about animals that surround us today and don’t let them disappear as it
    happened to their distant ancestors.
