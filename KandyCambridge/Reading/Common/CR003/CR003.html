  <h3>Reading Lesson 3: True False Not Given</h3>
  <h4><b>Chilies</b></h4>
  <p>
    Chilies originate in South America and have been eaten for at least 9,500
    years. Organised cultivation began around 5,400 BC. Christopher Columbus was
    the first European to encounter chilies, when he landed on the island of
    Hispaniola in 1492. He thought it was a type of pepper and called it the
    “red pepper”, a name still used today. After their introduction to Europe
    they were an immediate sensation and were quickly incorporated into the
    diet. From there they spread to Africa, India and East Asia.
  </p>
  <p>
    The reason for the chili’s “hotness” lies in a chemical called Capsaisin.
    Capsaisin causes temporary irritation to the trigeminal cells, which are the
    pain receptors in the mouth, nose and throat. After the pain messages are
    transmitted to the brain, endorphins, natural pain killers, are released and
    these not only kill the pain but give the chili eater a short lived natural
    high. Other side effects include: an increased heart rate, a running nose
    and increased salivation and sweating, which can have a cooling effect in
    hot climates.
  </p>
  <p>
    The reason for the presence of Capsaisin is thought to be to deter animals
    from eating the fruit. Only mammals feel the burning effects; birds feel
    nothing. As birds are a better method of distributing the seeds, which pass
    intact through their guts, Capsaisin would seem to be a result of natural
    selection.
  </p>
  <p>
    The smaller chilies tend to be the hottest. This may reflect the fact that
    they tend to grow closer to the ground and are therefore more vulnerable to
    animals. The heat of a chili is measured on the Scoville scale. The hottest
    types such as the Habenero and the Scotch Bonnet rate between 100,000 and
    300,000, the world famous Tabasco sauceÒ rates at 15,000 to 30,000, about
    the same as the Thai prik khee nu, while the popular Jalapeno is between
    5,000 and 15,000. Powdered chili is 500 to 1,000 and the mild capsicins and
    paprikas can range between 100 and 0.
