  <h4><b>Nutmeg - a valuable spice</b></h4>
  <p>
    The nutmeg tree, Myristica fragrans, is a large evergreen tree native to
    Southeast Asia. Until the late 18th century, it only grew in one place in
    the world: a small group of islands in the Banda Sea, part of the Moluccas –
    or Spice Islands – in northeastern Indonesia. The tree is thickly branched
    with dense foliage of tough, dark green oval leaves, and produces small,
    yellow, bell-shaped flowers and pale yellow pear-shaped fruits. The fruit is
    encased in a flesh husk. When the fruit is ripe, this husk splits into two
    halves along a ridge running the length of the fruit. Inside is a
    purple-brown shiny seed, 2-3 cm long by about 2 cm across, surrounded by a
    lacy red or crimson covering called an ‘aril’. These are the sources of the
    two spices nutmeg and mace, the former being produced from the dried seed
    and the latter from the aril.
  </p>
  <p>
    Nutmeg was a highly prized and costly ingredient in European cuisine in the
    Middle Ages, and was used as a flavouring, medicinal, and preservative
    agent. Throughout this period, the Arabs were the exclusive importers of the
    spice to Europe. They sold nutmeg for high prices to merchants based in
    Venice, but they never revealed the exact location of the source of this
    extremely valuable commodity. The Arab-Venetian dominance of the trade
    finally ended in 1512, when the Portuguese reached the Banda Islands and
    began exploiting its precious resources.
  </p>
  <p>
    Always in danger of competition from neighbouring Spain, the Portuguese
    began subcontracting their spice distribution to Dutch traders. Profits
    began to flow into the Netherlands, and the Dutch commercial fleet swiftly
    grew into one of the largest in the world. The Dutch quietly gained control
    of most of the shipping and trading of spices in Northern Europe. Then, in
    1580, Portugal fell under Spanish rule, and by the end of the 16th century
    the Dutch found themselves locked out of the market. As prices for pepper,
    nutmeg, and other spices soared across Europe, they decided to fight back.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 1602, Dutch merchants founded the VOC, a trading corporation better known
    as the Dutch East India Company. By 1617, the VOC was the richest commercial
    operation in the world. The company had 50,000 employees worldwide, with a
    private army of 30,000 men and a fleet of 200 ships. At the same time,
    thousands of people across Europe were dying of the plague, a highly
    contagious and deadly disease. Doctors were desperate for a way to stop the
    spread of this disease, and they decided nutmeg held the cure. Everybody
    wanted nutmeg, and many were willing to spare no expense to have it. Nutmeg
    bought for a few pennies in Indonesia could be sold for 68,000 times its
    original cost on the streets of London. The only problem was the short
    supply. And that’s where the Dutch found their opportunity.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Banda Islands were ruled by local sultans who insisted on maintaining a
    neutral trading policy towards foreign powers. This allowed them to avoid
    the presence of Portuguese or Spanish troops on their soil, but it also left
    them unprotected from other invaders. In 1621, the Dutch arrived and took
    over. Once securely in control of the Bandas, the Dutch went to work
    protecting their new investment. They concentrated all nutmeg production
    into a few easily guarded areas, uprooting and destroying any trees outside
    the plantation zones. Anyone caught growing a nutmeg seedling or carrying
    seeds without the proper authority was severely punished. In addition, all
    exported nutmeg was covered with lime to make sure there was no chance a
    fertile seed which could be grown elsewhere would leave the islands. There
    was only one obstacle to Dutch domination. One of the Banda Islands, a
    sliver of land called Run, only 3 km long by less than 1 km wide, was under
    the control of the British. After decades of fighting for control of this
    tiny island, the Dutch and British arrived at a compromise settlement, the
    Treaty of Breda, in 1667. Intent on securing their hold over every
    nutmeg-producing island, the Dutch offered a trade: if the British would
    give them the island of Run, they would in turn give Britain a distant and
    much less valuable island in North America. The British agreed. That other
    island was Manhattan, which is how New Amsterdam became New York. The Dutch
    now had a monopoly over the nutmeg trade which would last for another
    century.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then, in 1770, a Frenchman named Pierre Poivre successfully smuggled nutmeg
    plants to safety in Mauritius, an island off the coast of Africa. Some of
    these were later exported to the Caribbean where they thrived, especially on
    the island of Grenada. Next, in 1778, a volcanic eruption in the Banda
    region caused a tsunami that wiped out half the nutmeg groves. Finally, in
    1809, the British returned to Indonesia and seized the Banda Islands by
    force. They returned the islands to the Dutch in 1817, but not before
    transplanting hundreds of nutmeg seedlings to plantations in several
    locations across southern Asia. The Dutch nutmeg monopoly was over.
  </p>
  <p>
    Today, nutmeg is grown in Indonesia, the Caribbean, India, Malaysia, Papua
    New Guinea and Sri Lanka, and world nutmeg production is estimated to
    average between 10,000 and 12,000 tonnes per year.
