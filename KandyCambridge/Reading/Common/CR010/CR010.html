  <h4><b>A spark, a flint: How fire leapt to life</b></h4>
  <p>
    European settlement of Australia began in 1788 when a British penal colony
    was established on the east coast. From this starting point Australia grew
    rapidly and continually, expanding across the entire continent.
  </p>
  <p>
    The control of fire was the first and perhaps greatest of humanity’s steps
    towards a life-enhancing technology.
  </p>
  <p>
    To early man, the fire was a divine gift randomly delivered in the form of
    lightning, forest fire or burning lava. Unable to make flame for themselves,
    the earliest peoples probably stored fire by keeping slow burning logs
    alight or by carrying charcoal in pots.
  </p>
  <p>
    How and where man learnt how to produce flame at will is unknown. It was
    probably a secondary invention, accidentally made during tool-making
    operations with wood or stone. Studies of primitive societies suggest that
    the earliest method of making fire was through friction. European peasants
    would insert a wooden drill in a round hole and rotate it briskly between
    their palms this process could be speeded up by wrapping a cord around the
    drill and pulling on each end.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Ancient Greeks used lenses or concave mirrors to concentrate the sun’s
    rays and burning glasses were also used by Mexican Aztecs and the Chinese.
    Percussion methods of fire-lighting date back to Paleolithic times, when
    some Stone Age toolmakers discovered that chipping flints produced sparks.
    The technique became more efficient after the discovery of iron, about 5000
    years ago In Arctic North America, the Eskimos produced a slow-burning spark
    by striking quartz against iron pyrites, a compound that contains sulphur.
    The Chinese lit their fires by striking porcelain with bamboo. In Europe,
    the combination of steel, flint and tinder remained the main method of fire
    lighting until the mid-19th century.
  </p>
  <p>
    Fire-lighting was revolutionized by the discovery of phosphorus, isolated in
    1669 by a German alchemist trying to transmute silver into gold. Impressed
    by the element’s combustibility, several 17th-century chemists used it to
    manufacture fire-lighting devices, but the results were dangerously
    inflammable. With phosphorus costing the equivalent of several hundred
    pounds per ounce, the first matches were expensive.
  </p>
  <p>
    The quest for a practical match really began after 1781 when a group of
    French chemists came up with the Phosphoric Candle or Ethereal Match, a
    sealed glass tube containing a twist of paper tipped with phosphorus. When
    the tube was broken, air rushed in, causing the phosphorus self-combust. An
    even more hazardous device, popular in America, was the Instantaneous Light
    Box — a bottle filled with sulphuric acid into which splints treated with
    chemicals were dipped.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first matches resembling those used today were made in 1827 by John
    Walker, an English pharmacist who borrowed the formula from a military
    rocket-maker called Congreve. Costing a shilling a box, Congreves were
    splints coated with sulphur and tipped with potassium chlorate. To light
    them, the user drew them quickly through folded glass paper. Walker never
    patented his invention, and three years later it was copied by a Samuel
    Jones, who marketed his product as Lucifers. About the same time, a French
    chemistry student called Charles Sauria produced the first “strike-anywhere”
    match by substituting white phosphorus for the potassium chlorate in the
    Walker formula. However, since white phosphorus is a deadly poison, from
    1845 match-makers exposed to its fumes succumbed to necrosis, a disease that
    eats away jaw-bones. It wasn’t until 1906 that the substance was eventually
    banned.
  </p>
  <p>
    That was 62 years after a Swedish chemist called Pasch had discovered
    non-toxic red or amorphous phosphorus, a development exploited commercially
    by Pasch’s compatriot J E Lundstrom in 1885. Lundstrom’s safety matches were
    safe because the red phosphorus was non-toxic; it was painted on to the
    striking surface instead of the match tip, which contained potassium
    chlorate with a relatively high ignition temperature of 182 degrees
    centigrade. America lagged behind Europe in match technology and safety
    standards. It wasn’t until 1900 that the Diamond Match Company bought a
    French patent for safety matches — but the formula did not work properly in
    the different climatic conditions prevailing in America and it was another
    11 years before scientists finally adapted the French patent for the US. The
    Americans, however, can claim several “firsts” in match technology and
    marketing. In 1892 the Diamond Match Company pioneered book matches. The
    innovation didn’t catch on until after 1896, when a brewery had the novel
    idea of advertising its product in match books. Today book matches are the
    most widely used type in the US, with 90 percent handed out free by hotels,
    restaurants and others.
  </p>
  <p>
    Other American innovations include an anti-after-glow solution to prevent
    the match from smouldering after it has been blown out; and the waterproof
    match, which lights after eight hours in water.

  <h4>EARLY FIRE-LIGHTING METHODS</h4>
  <p>
    They tried to

    burning logs or charcoal
    <input type="text" name="q2" placeholder="2" style="width: 150px" />
    that they could create fire themselves. It is suspected that the first
    man-made flames were produced by
    <input type="text" name="q3" placeholder="3" style="width: 150px" />. The
    very first fire-lighting methods involved the creation of
    <input type="text" name="q4" placeholder="4" style="width: 150px" />
    by, for example, rapidly
    <input type="text" name="q5" placeholder="5" style="width: 150px" />
    a wooden stick in a round hole. The use of
    <input type="text" name="q6" placeholder="6" style="width: 150px" />
    or persistent chipping was also widespread in Europe and among other peoples
    such as the Chinese and
    <input type="text" name="q7" placeholder="7" style="width: 150px" />.
    European practice of this method continued until the 1850s
