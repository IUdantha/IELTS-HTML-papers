  <h3>Reading Lesson 4: Yes, No, Not Given Questions</h3>
  <h4><b>People of Corn</b></h4>
  <p>
    Maize is Mexico’s lifeblood – the country’s history and identity are
    entwined with it. But this centuries-old relationship is now threatened by
    free trade. Laura Carlsen investigates the threat and profiles a growing
    activist movement.
  </p>
  <p>
    On a mountain top in southern Mexico, Indian families gather. They chant and
    sprinkle cornmeal in consecration, praying for the success of their new
    crops, the unity of their communities, and the health of their families. In
    this village in Oaxaca, people eat corn tamales, sow maize plots and teach
    children to care for the plant. The cultural rhythms of this community, its
    labors, rituals, and celebrations will be defined – as they have been for
    millennia – by the lifecycle of corn. Indeed, if it weren’t for the
    domestication of teocintle (the ancestor of modern maize) 9,000 years ago
    mesoamerican civilization could never have developed. In the Mayan sacred
    book, the Popol Vuh, the gods create people out of cornmeal. The ‘people of
    corn’ flourished and built one of the most remarkable cultures in human
    history.
  </p>
  <p>
    But in Mexico and Central America today maize has come under attack. As a
    result of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) Mexico has been
    flooded with imported corn from north of the border in the US. The
    contamination of native varieties with genetically modified imported maize
    could have major consequences for Mexican Campesinos (farmers), for local
    biodiversity, and for the world’s genetic reserves.
  </p>
  <p>
    A decade ago Mexican bureaucrats and business people had it all figured out.
    NAFTA would drive ‘uncompetitive’ maize farmers from the countryside to work
    in booming assembly factories across the country. Their standard of living
    would rise as the cost of providing services like electricity and water to
    scattered rural communities would fall. Best of all, cheap imported maize
    from the US – the world’s most efficient and most heavily subsidized
    producer – would be a benefit to Mexican consumers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, it didn’t turn out that way. There weren’t quite enough of
    those factory jobs and the ones that did materialize continued to be along
    the US border, not further in Mexico. And despite a huge drop in the price
    farmers received for their corn, consumers often ended up paying more. The
    price of tortillas – the country’s staple food – rose nearly fivefold as the
    Government stopped domestic subsidies and giant agribusiness firms took over
    the market. Free trade defenders like Mexico’s former Under-Secretary of
    Agriculture Luis Tellez suggest: ‘It’s not that NAFTA failed, it’s just that
    reality didn’t turn out the way we planned it.’ Part of that reality was
    that the Government did nothing to help Campesinos in the supposed
    transition. Nor did NAFTA recognize inequalities or create compensation
    funds to help the victims of free trade – unlike what occurred with economic
    integration in the European Union.
  </p>
  <p>
    Basically, Mexico adopted a sink-or-swim policy for small farmers, opening
    the floodgates to tons of imported US corn. Maize imports tripled under
    NAFTA and producer prices fell by half. The drop in income immediately hit
    the most vulnerable and poorest members of rural society. While more than a
    third of the corn grown by small farmers is used to feed their families, the
    rest is sold on local markets. Without this critical cash, rural living
    standards plunged.
  </p>
  <p>
    Maize is at the heart of indigenous and Campesino identity. José Carrillo de
    la Cruz, a Huichol Indian from northern Jalisco, describes that
    relationship: ‘Corn is the force, the life and the strength of the Huichol.
    If there were a change, if someone from outside patented our corn, it would
    end our life and existence.’
  </p>
  <p>
    The good news is that the free-trade threat to Mexico’s culture and food
    security has sparked a lively resistance. ‘In Defence of Corn’, a movement
    to protect local maize varieties, is not a membership organization but a
    series of forums and actions led by Campesinos themselves. It’s a direct
    challenge to both free trade and the dictums of corporate science.
  </p>
  <p>
    The farmers’ tenacity and refusal to abandon the crop of their ancestors is
    impressive. But larger economic conditions continue to shape their lives.
    Rural poverty and hunger have soared under free trade – and placed a heavier
    burden on women left to work the land. The battle for food sovereignty
    continues. Movement leaders insist that the Government reassess its free
    trade policies and develop a real rural development program.

    For thousands of years, corn has been a very important
    <input type="text" name="q6" placeholder="6" style="width: 200px" />
    in the Mexican culture. After the North American Free Trade Agreement,
    <input type="text" name="q7" placeholder="7" style="width: 200px" />
    corn has been imported from the USA in very large amounts. Mexican business
    people hoped that this would mean that Mexican farmers had to get jobs in
    factories and that their
    <input type="text" name="q8" placeholder="8" style="width: 200px" />
    would increase. Instead of this result, the farmers suffered from the low
    price of corn and people had to pay more for their corn. The farmers wish
    that the government had
    <input type="text" name="q9" placeholder="9" style="width: 200px" />
    them during this time. As a result of the hardship, the farmers have
    organized themselves by forming a
