  <h4><b>Conquering Earth’s space junk problem</b></h4>

  <p>
    Satellites, rocket shards and collision debris are creating major traffic
    risks in orbit around the planet. Researchers are working to reduce these
    threats
    <br /><br /><b>A.</b> Last year, commercial companies, military and civil
    departments and amateurs sent more than 400 satellites into orbit, over four
    times the yearly average in the previous decade. Numbers could rise even
    more sharply if leading space companies follow through on plans to deploy
    hundreds to thousands of large constellations of satellites to space in the
    next few years. <br /><br />All that traffic can lead to disaster. Ten years
    ago, a US commercial Iridium satellite smashed into an inactive Russian
    communications satellite called Cosmos-2251, creating thousands of new
    pieces of space shrapnel that now threaten other satellites in low Earth
    orbit – the zone stretching up to 2,000 kilometres in altitude. Altogether,
    there are roughly 20,000 human-made objects in orbit, from working
    satellites to small rocket pieces. And satellite operators can’t steer away
    from every potential crash, because each move consumes time and fuel that
    could otherwise be used for the spacecraft’s main job. <br /><br /><b>B.</b>
    Concern about space junk goes back to the beginning of the satellite era,
    but the number of objects in orbit is rising so rapidly that researchers are
    investigating new ways of attacking the problem. Several teams are trying to
    improve methods for assessing what is in orbit, so that satellite operators
    can work more efficiently in ever-more-crowded space. Some researchers are
    now starting to compile a massive data set that includes the best possible
    information on where everything is in orbit. Others are developing
    taxonomies of space – working on measuring properties such as the shape and
    size of an object, so that satellite operators know how much to worry about
    what’s coming their way. <br /><br />The alternative, many say, is
    unthinkable. Just a few uncontrolled space crashes could generate enough
    debris to set off a runaway cascade of fragments, rendering near-Earth space
    unusable. ‘If we go on like this, we will reach a point of no return,’ says
    Carolin Frueh, an astrodynamical researcher at Purdue University in West
    Lafayette, Indiana. <br /><br /><b>C.</b> Even as our ability to monitor
    space objects increases, so too does the total number of items in orbit.
    That means companies, governments and other players in space are
    collaborating in new ways to avoid a shared threat. International groups
    such as the Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee have developed
    guidelines on space sustainability. Those include inactivating satellites at
    the end of their useful life by venting pressurised materials or leftover
    fuel that might lead to explosions. The intergovernmental groups also advise
    lowering satellites deep enough into the atmosphere that they will burn up
    or disintegrate within 25 years. But so far, only about half of all missions
    have abided by this 25-year goal, says Holger Krag, head of the European
    Space Agency’s space-debris office in Darmstadt, Germany. Operators of the
    planned large constellations of satellites say they will be responsible
    stewards in their enterprises in space, but Krag worries that problems could
    increase, despite their best intentions. ‘What happens to those that fail or
    go bankrupt?’ he asks. They are probably not going to spend money to remove
    their satellites from space.’ <br /><br /><b>D.</b> In theory, given the
    vastness of space, satellite operators should have plenty of room for all
    these missions to fly safely without ever nearing another object. So some
    scientists are tackling the problem of space junk by trying to find out
    where all the debris is to a high degree of precision. That would alleviate
    the need for many of the unnecessary manoeuvres that are carried out to
    avoid potential collisions. ‘If you knew precisely where everything was, you
    would almost never have a problem,’ says Marlon Sorge, a space-debris
    specialist at the Aerospace Corporation in El Segundo, California.
    <br /><br /><b>E.</b> The field is called space traffic management, because
    it’s similar to managing traffic on the roads or in the air. Think about a
    busy day at an airport, says Moriba Jah, an astrodynamicist at the
    University of Texas at Austin: planes line up in the sky, landing and taking
    off close to one another in a carefully choreographed routine. Air-traffic
    controllers know the location of the planes down to one metre in accuracy.
    The same can’t be said for space debris. Not all objects in orbit are known,
    and even those included in databases are not tracked consistently.
    <br /><br /><b>F.</b> An additional problem is that there is no
    authoritative catalogue that accurately lists the orbits of all known space
    debris. Jah illustrates this with a web-based database that he has
    developed. It draws on several sources, such as catalogues maintained by the
    US and Russian governments, to visualise where objects are in space. When he
    types in an identifier for a particular space object, the database draws a
    purple line to designate its orbit. Only this doesn’t quite work for a
    number of objects, such as a Russian rocket body designated in the database
    as object number 32280. When Jah enters that number, the database draws two
    purple lines: the US and Russian sources contain two completely different
    orbits for the same object. Jah says that it is almost impossible to tell
    which is correct, unless a third source of information made it possible to
    cross-correlate. <br /><br />Jah describes himself as a space
    environmentalist: ‘I want to make space a place that is safe to operate,
    that is free and useful for generations to come.’ Until that happens, he
    argues, the space community will continue devolving into a tragedy in which
    all spaceflight operators are polluting a common resource.

  <h3>Questions 32–35</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Choose ONE WORD ONLY</strong> from the passage for each answer.<br />Write
    your answers in boxes 32–35 on your answer sheet.
  </p>
  <p><strong>The Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee</strong></p>
  <p>
    The committee gives advice on how the <strong>32</strong>
    <input type="text" name="q32" style="width: 150px" /> of space can be
    achieved. The committee advises that when satellites are no longer active,
    any unused <strong>33</strong>
    <input type="text" name="q33" style="width: 150px" /> or pressurised
    material that could cause <strong>34</strong>
    <input type="text" name="q34" style="width: 150px" /> should be removed.<br /><br />
    Although operators of large satellite constellations accept that they have
    obligations as stewards of space, Holger Krag points out that the operators
    that become <strong>35</strong>
    <input type="text" name="q35" style="width: 150px" /> are unlikely to
    prioritise removing their satellites from space.
