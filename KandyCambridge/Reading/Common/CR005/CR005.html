  <h3>Reading Lesson 5: Completion Tasks</h3>
  <h4><b>European Settlement of Australia</b></h4>
  <p>
    European settlement of Australia began in 1788 when a British penal colony
    was established on the east coast. From this starting point Australia grew
    rapidly and continually, expanding across the entire continent.
  </p>
  <p>
    A number of reasons contributed to Britain's decision to colonise Australia.
    The most important factor was Britain's need to relieve its overcrowded
    prisons. Several violent incidents at overcrowded prisons convinced the
    British government of the need to separate unruly elements from the rest of
    the prison populace.
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, Australia was of strategic importance to Britain, and it
    provided a base for the Royal Navy in the eastern sea. Also, Australia could
    be used as an entry point to the economic opportunities of the surrounding
    region. All these points figured in the decision by Lord Sydney, secretary
    of state of home affairs, to authorise the colonisation.
  </p>
  <p>
    To this affect, on May 13, 1787, Captain Arthur Phillip, commanding eleven
    ships full of convicts, left Britain for Australia. He successfully landed a
    full fleet at Botany Bay on January 18, 1788. However, they left the bay
    eight days later because of its openness and poor soil, and settled instead
    at Port Jackson, a few kilometres north. The ships landed 1,373 people,
    including 732 convicts, and the settlement became Sydney. Australia Day is
    now celebrated on 26 January each year, to commemorate this first fleet
    landing.

  <h4><b>Dirty River but Clean Water</b></h4>
  <p>
    Floods once raged through the canyon every year. Spring Snow from as far
    away as Wyoming would melt and swell the Colorado river to a flow that
    averaged around 1,500 cubic metres (50,000 cubic feet) a second. These
    floods infused the river with sediment, carved its beaches and built its
    sandbars. However, in the four decades since the building of the Glen Canyon
    dam, just upstream of the Grand Canyon, the only sediment that it has
    collected has come from tiny, undammed tributaries. This lack of flooding
    has harmed local wildlife. In the years since the Glen Canyon dam was built,
    several species have vanished altogether. These include the Colorado
    pike-minnow, the razorback sucker and the round-tail chub. Meanwhile, aliens
    including fathead minnows, channel catfish and common carp, which would have
    been hard to survive in the savage waters of the undammed canyon, have moved
    in. So flooding is the obvious answer. Unfortunately, it is easier said than
    done. Floods were sent down the Grand Canyon in 1996 and 2004 and the
    results were mixed. In 1996 the flood was allowed to go on too long. To
    start with,all seemed well. The floodwaters built up sandbanks and infused
    the river with sediment.

    The snow from far Wyoming would melt in the season of
    <input type="text" name="q1" placeholder="1" style="width: 200px" />
    and caused a flood flow peak in the Colorado river. In the four decades

    together from tiny, undammed tributaries. Then, several species disappeared

    and the round-tail chub. Meanwhile, some moved in such as fathead minnows,
