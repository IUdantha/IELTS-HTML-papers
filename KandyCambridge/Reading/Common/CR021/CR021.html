  <h4><b>Why Fairy Tales are Really Scary Tales</b></h4>

  <p>
    Some people think that fairy tales are just stories to amuse children, but
    their universal and enduring appeal may be due to more serious reasons.
    <br /><br />People of every culture tell each other fairy tales but the same
    story often takes a variety of forms in different parts of the world. In the
    story of Little Red Riding Hood that European children are familiar with, a
    young girl on the way to see her grandmother meets a wolf and tells him
    where she is going. The wolf runs on ahead and disposes of the grandmother,
    then gets into bed dressed in the grandmother’s clothes to wait for Little
    Red Riding Hood. You may think you know the story – but which version? In
    some versions, the wolf swallows up the grandmother, while in others it
    locks her in a cupboard. In some stories, Red Riding Hood gets the better of
    the wolf on her own, while in others a hunter or a woodcutter hears her
    cries and comes to her rescue. <br /><br />The universal appeal of these
    tales is frequently attributed to the idea that they contain cautionary
    messages: in the case of Little Red Riding Hood, to listen to your mother,
    and avoid talking to strangers. ‘It might be what we find interesting about
    this story is that it’s got this survival-relevant information in it,’ says
    anthropologist Jamie Tehrani at Durham University in the UK. But his
    research suggests otherwise. ‘We have this huge gap in our knowledge about
    the history and prehistory of storytelling, despite the fact that we know
    this genre is an incredibly ancient one,’ he says. That hasn’t stopped
    anthropologists, folklorists* and other academics devising theories to
    explain the importance of fairy tales in human society. Now Tehrani has
    found a way to test these ideas, borrowing a technique from evolutionary
    biologists. <br /><br />To work out the evolutionary history, development
    and relationships among groups of organisms, biologists compare the
    characteristics of living species in a process called ‘phylogenetic
    analysis’. Tehrani has used the same approach to compare related versions of
    fairy tales to discover how they have evolved and which elements have
    survived longest. Tehrani’s analysis focused on Little Red Riding Hood in
    its many forms, which include another Western fairy tale known as The Wolf
    and the Kids. Checking for variants of these two tales and similar stories
    from Africa, East Asia and other regions, he ended up with 58 stories
    recorded from oral traditions. Once his phylogenetic analysis had
    established that they were indeed related, he used the same methods to
    explore how they have developed and altered over time. <br /><br />First, he
    tested some assumptions about which aspects of the story alter least as it
    evolves, indicating their importance. Folklorists believe that what happens
    in a story is more central to the story than the characters in it – that
    visiting a relative, only to be met by a scary animal in disguise, is more
    fundamental than whether the visitor is a little girl or three siblings, or
    the animal is a tiger instead of a wolf. <br /><br />However, Tehrani found
    no significant difference in the rate of evolution of incidents compared
    with that of characters. ‘Certain episodes are very stable because they are
    crucial to the story, but there are lots of other details that can evolve
    quite freely,’ he says. Neither did his analysis support the theory that the
    central section of a story is the most conserved part. He found no
    significant difference in the flexibility of events there compared with the
    beginning or the end. But the really big surprise came when he looked at the
    cautionary elements of the story. ‘Studies on hunter-gatherer folk tales
    suggest that these narratives include really important information about the
    environment and the possible dangers that may be faced there – stuff that’s
    relevant to survival,’ he says. Yet in his analysis such elements were just
    as flexible as seemingly trivial details. What, then, is important enough to
    be reproduced from generation to generation? <br /><br />The answer, it
    would appear, is fear – blood-thirsty and gruesome aspects of the story,
    such as the eating of the grandmother by the wolf, turned out to be the best
    preserved of all. Why are these details retained by generations of
    storytellers, when other features are not? Tehrani has an idea: ‘In an oral
    context, a story won’t survive because of one great teller. It also needs to
    be interesting when it’s told by someone who’s not necessarily a great
    storyteller.’ Maybe being swallowed whole by a wolf, then cut out of its
    stomach alive is so gripping that it helps the story remain popular, no
    matter how badly it’s told. <br /><br />Jack Zipes at the University of
    Minnesota, Minneapolis, is unconvinced by Tehrani’s views on fairy tales.
    ‘Even if they’re gruesome, they won’t stick unless they matter,’ he says. He
    believes the perennial theme of women as victims in stories like Little Red
    Riding Hood explains why they continue to feel relevant. But Tehrani points
    out that although this is often the case in Western versions, it is not
    always true elsewhere. In Chinese and Japanese versions, often known as The
    Tiger Grandmother, the villain is a woman, and in both Iran and Nigeria, the
    victim is a boy. Tehrani’s findings did not surprise Mathias Clasen at
    Aarhus University in Denmark. ‘Habits and morals change, but the things that
    scare us, and the fact that we seek out entertainment that’s designed to
    scare us – those are constant,’ he says. Clasen believes that scary stories
    teach us what it feels like to be afraid without having to experience real
    danger, and so build up resistance to negative emotions. <br /><br /><b
