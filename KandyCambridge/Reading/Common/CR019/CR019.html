  <h4><b>CHILDREN'S THINKING</b></h4>

  <p>
    One of the most eminent of psychologists, Clark Hull, claimed that the
    essence of reasoning lies in the putting together of two 'behaviour
    segments' in some novel way, never actually performed before, so as to reach
    a goal.
    <br /><br />Two followers of Clark Hull, Howard and Tracey Kendler, devised
    a test for children that was explicitly based on Clark Hull's principles.
    The children were given the task of learning to operate a machine so as to
    get a toy. In order to succeed, they had to go through a two-stage sequence.
    The children were trained on each stage separately. The stages consisted
    merely of pressing the correct one of two buttons to get a marble; and of
    inserting the marble into a small hole to release the toy. <br /><br />The
    Kendlers found that the children could learn the separate bits readily
    enough. Given the task of getting a marble by pressing the button they could
    get the marble; given the task of getting a toy when a marble was handed to
    them, they could use the marble. (All they had to do was put it in a hole.)
    But they did not for the most part 'integrate', to use the Kendlers'
    terminology. They did not press the button to get the marble and then
    proceed without further help to use the marble to get the toy. So the
    Kendlers concluded that they were incapable of deductive reasoning.
    <br /><br />The mystery at first appears to deepen when we learn, from
    another psychologist, Michael Cole, and his colleagues, that adults in an
    African culture apparently cannot do the Kendlers' task either. But it
    lessens, on the other hand, when we learn that a task was devised which was
    strictly analogous to the Kendlers' one but much easier for the African
    males to handle. <br /><br />Instead of the button-pressing machine, Cole
    used a locked box and two differently coloured matchboxes, one of which
    contained a key that would open the box. Notice that there are still two
    behaviour segments — 'open the right match-box to get the key' and 'use the
    key to open the box' - so the task seems formally to be the same. But
    psychologically it is quite different, Now the subject is dealing not with a
    strange machine but with familiar meaningful objects, and it is clear to him
    what he is meant to do. It then turns out that the difficulty of
    'integration' is greatly reduced. <br /><br />Recent work by Simon Hewson is
    of great interest here for it shows that, for young children, too, the
    difficulty lies not in the inferential processes which the task demands, but
    in certain perplexing features of the apparatus and the procedure. When
    these are changed in ways which do not at all affect the inferential nature
    of the problem, then five-year-old children solve the problem as well as
    college students did in the Kendlers' own experiments. <br /><br />Hewson
    made two crucial changes. First, he replaced the button-pressing mechanism
    in the side panels by drawers in these panels which the child could open and
    shut. This took away the mystery from the first stage of training. Then he
    helped the child to understand that there was no 'magic' about the specific
    marble which, during the second stage of training, the experimenter handed
    to him so that he could pop it in the hole and get the reward. <br /><br />A
    child understands nothing, after all, about how a marble put into a hole can
    open a little door. How is he to know that any other marble of similar size
    will do just as well? Yet he must assume that if he is to solve the problem.
    Hewson made the functional equivalence of different marbles clear by playing
    a 'swapping game' with the children. The two modifications together produced
    a jump in success rates from 30 percent to 90 percent for five-year, the
    olds and from 35 percent to 72.5 per cent for four-year-olds. For three-year
    olds, for reasons that are still in need of clarification, no improvement —
    rather a slight drop in performance - resulted from the change.
    <br /><br />We may conclude, then, that children experience very real
    difficulty when faced with the Kendler apparatus; but this difficulty cannot
    be taken as proof that they are incapable of deductive reasoning.
