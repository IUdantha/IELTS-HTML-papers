  <p>You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 1-13, which are based on the reading passage below.</p>
  <h3>The life and work of Marie Curie</h3>
  <p>
    Marie Curie is probably the most famous woman scientist who has ever lived. Born Maria Sklodowska in Poland in 1867,
    she is famous for her work on radioactivity, and was twice a winner of the Nobel Prize. With her husband, Pierre
    Curie and Henri Becquerel, she was awarded the 1903 Nobel Prize for Physics, and was then sole winner of the 1911
    Nobel Prize for Chemistry. She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize.
  </p>
  <p>
    From childhood, Marie was remarkable for her prodigious memory, and at the age of 16 won a gold medal on completion
    of her secondary education. Because her father lost his savings through bad investment, she then had to take work as
    a teacher. From her earnings, she was able to finance her sister Bronia's medical studies in Paris, on the
    understanding that Bronia would, in turn, later help her to get an education.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 1891 this promise was fulfilled and Marie went to Paris and began to study at the Sorbonne (the University of
    Paris). She often worked far into the night and lived on little more than bread and butter and tea. She came first
    in the examination in the physical sciences in 1893, and in 1894 was placed second in the examination in
    mathematical sciences. It was not until the spring of that year that she was introduced to Pierre Curie.
  </p>
  <p>
    Their marriage in 1895 marked the start of a partnership that was soon to achieve results of world significance.
    Following Henri Becquerel’s discovery in 1896 of a new phenomenon, which Marie later called "radioactivity", Marie
    Curie decided to find out if the radioactivity discovered in uranium was to be found in other elements. She
    discovered that this was true for thorium.
  </p>
  <p>
    Turning her attention to minerals, she found her interest drawn to pitchblende, a mineral whose radioactivity,
    superior to that of pure uranium, could be explained only by the presence in the ore of small quantities of an
    unknown substance of very high activity. Pierre Curie joined her in the work that she had undertaken to resolve this
    problem, and that led to the discovery of the new elements, polonium and radium. While Pierre Curie devoted himself
    chiefly to the physical study of the new radiations, Marie Curie struggled to obtain pure radium in the metallic
    state. This was achieved with the help of the chemist André-Louis Debierne, one of Pierre Curie's pupils. Based on
    the results of this research, Marie Curie received her Doctorate of Science, and in 1903 Marie and Pierre shared
    with Becquerel the Nobel Prize for Physics for the discovery of radioactivity.
  </p>
  <p>
    The births of Marie's two daughters, Irene and Eve, in 1897 and 1904 failed to interrupt her scientific work. She
    was appointed lecturer in physics at the École Normale Supérieure for girls in Sèvres, France (1900), and introduced
    a method of teaching based on experimental demonstrations. In December 1904 she was appointed chief assistant in the
    laboratory directed by Pierre Curie.
  </p>
  <p>
    The sudden death of her husband in 1906 was a bitter blow to Marie Curie, but was also a turning point in her
    career: henceforth she was to devote all her energy to completing alone the scientific work that they had
    undertaken. On May 19, 1906, she was appointed to the professorship that had been left vacant on her husband's
    death, becoming the first woman to teach at the Sorbonne. In 1911 she was awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry for
    the isolation of a pure form of radium.
  </p>
  <p>
    During World War I, Marie Curie, with the help of her daughter Irene, devoted herself to the development of the use
    of X‑radiography, including the mobile units which came to be known as "little Curies", used for the treatment of
    wounded soldiers. In 1918 the Radium Institute, whose staff Irene had joined, began to operate in earnest, and
    became a centre for nuclear physics and chemistry. Marie Curie, now at the highest point of her fame and, from 1922,
    a member of the Academy of Medicine, researched the chemistry of radioactive substances and their medical
    applications.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 1921, accompanied by her two daughters, Marie Curie made a triumphant journey to the United States to raise funds
    for research on radium. Women there presented her with a gram of radium for her campaign. Marie also gave lectures
    in Belgium, Brazil, Spain and Czechoslovakia and, in addition, had the satisfaction of seeing the development of the
    Curie Foundation in Paris and the inauguration in 1932 in Warsaw of the Radium Institute, where her sister Bronia
    became the director.
  </p>
  <p>
    One of Marie Curie's outstanding achievements was to have understood the need to accumulate intense radioactive
    sources, not only to treat illness but also to maintain an abundant supply for research. The existence in Paris at
    the Radium Institute of a stock of grams of radium made a decisive contribution to the success of the experiments
    undertaken in the years around 1930. This work prepared the way for the discovery of the neutron by Sir James
    Chadwick and, above all, for the discovery in 1934 by Irene and Frédéric Joliot‑Curie of artificial radioactivity. A
    few months after this discovery, Marie Curie died as a result of leukaemia caused by exposure to radiation. She had
    often carried test tubes containing radioactive isotopes in her pocket, remarking on the pretty blue‑green light
    they gave off.
  </p>
  <p>
    Her contribution to physics had been immense, not only in her own work—the importance of which had been demonstrated
    by her two Nobel Prizes—but because of her influence on subsequent generations of nuclear physicists and chemists.

  <h2>
    <u>Section 02</u><br>
    <span style="font-size: smaller;">Questions <b>14 - 26</b></span>
  </h2>
  <p>You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 14-26, which are based on the reading passage below.</p>
  <h3>IS THERE ANYBODY OUT THERE?</h3>
  <h4>The Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence</h4>
  <p>
    The question of whether we are alone in the Universe has haunted humanity for centuries, but we may now stand poised
    on the brink of the answer to that question, as we search for radio signals from other intelligent civilizations.
    This search is often known by the acronym SETI [search for extraterrestrial intelligence], is a difficult one.
    Although groups around the world have been searching intermittently for three decades, it is only now that we have
    reached the level of technology where we can make a determined attempt to search all nearby stars for any sign of
    life.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>A.</strong> The primary reason for the search is basic curiosity - the same curiosity about the natural
    world that drives all pure science. We want to know whether we are alone in the Universe. We want to know whether
    life evolves naturally if given the right conditions, or whether there is something very special about the Earth to
    have fostered the variety of life forms that we see around us on the planet. The simple detection of a radio signal
    will be sufficient to answer this most basic of all questions. In this sense, SETI is another cog in the machinery
    of pure science which is continually pushing out the horizon of our knowledge. However, there are other reasons for
    being interested in whether life exists elsewhere. For example, we have had civilization on Earth for perhaps only a
    few thousand years, and the threats of nuclear war and pollution over the last few decades have told us that our
    survival may be tenuous. Will we last another two thousand years or will we wipe ourselves out? Since the lifetime
    of a planet like ours is several billion years, we can expect that if other civilizations do survive in our galaxy,
    their ages will range from zero to several billion years. Thus any other civilization that we hear from is likely to
    be far older on average than ourselves. The mere existence of such a civilization will tell of that long-term
    survival is possible, and gives us some cause for optimism. It is even possible that the older civilization may pass
    on the benefits of their experience in dealing with threats to survival such as nuclear war and global pollution,
    and other threats that we haven't yet discovered.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>B.</strong> In discussing whether we are alone, most SETI scientists adopt two ground rules. First, UFOs
    [Unidentified Flying Objects] are generally ignored since most scientists don't consider the evidence for them to be
    strong enough to bear serious consideration (although it is also important to keep an open mind in case any really
    convincing evidence emerges in the future). Second, we make a very conservative assumption that we are looking for a
    life form that is pretty well like us, since if it differs radically from us we may well not recognize it as a life
    form, quite apart from whatever we are able to communicate with it. In other words, the life form we are looking for
    may well have two green heads and seven fingers, but it will nevertheless resemble us in that it should communicate
    with its fellows. Be interested in the Universe, live on a planet orbiting a star like our Sun, and perhaps most
    restrictively have chemistry, like us, based on carbon and water.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>C.</strong> Even when we make these assumptions, our understanding of other life forms is still severely
    limited. We do not even know, for example, how many stars have planets, and we certainly do not know how likely it
    is that life will arise naturally, given the right conditions. However, when we look at the 100 billion stars in our
    galaxy [the Milky Way], and 100 billion galaxies in the observable Universe, it seems inconceivable that at least
    one of these planets does not have a life form on it; in fact, the best educated guess we can make using the little
    that we do know about the conditions for carbon-based life leads us to estimate that perhaps one in 100,000 stars
    might have a life-bearing planet orbiting it. That means that our nearest neighbors are perhaps 1000 light years
    away, which is almost next door in astronomical terms.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>D.</strong> An alien civilization could choose many different ways of sending information across the galaxy,
    but many of these either require too much energy or else are severely attenuated while traversing the vast distances
    across the galaxy. It turns out that for a given amount of transmitted power, radio waves in the frequency range
    1000 to 3000 MHz travel the greatest distance, and so all searches to date have concentrated on looking for radio
    waves in this frequency range. So far there have been a number of searches by various groups around the world,
    including Australian searches using the radio telescope at Parkes, New South Wales. Until now there have not been
    any detections from the few hundred stars which have been searched. The scale of the searches has been increased
    dramatically since 1992, when the US Congress voted NASA $10 million per year for ten years to conduct a thorough
    search for extra-terrestrial life. Much of the money in this project is being spent on developing the special
    hardware needed to search many frequencies at once. The project has two parts. One part is a targeted search using
    the world's largest radio telescopes—the American-operated telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, and the French
    telescope in Nancy in France. This part of the project is searching the nearest 1000 likely stars with a high
    sensitivity for signals in the frequency range 1000 to 3000 MHz. The other part of the project is an undirected
    search which is monitoring all of space with a lower sensitivity using the smaller antennas of NASA’s Deep Space
    Network.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>E.</strong> There is considerable debate over how we should react if we detect a signal from an alien
    civilization. Everybody agrees that we should not reply immediately. Quite apart from the impracticality of sending
    a reply over such large distances at short notice, it raises a host of ethical questions that would have to be
    addressed by the global community before any reply could be sent. Would the human race face the culture shock if
    faced with a superior and much older civilization? Luckily, there is no urgency about this. The stars being searched
    are hundreds of light years away, so it takes hundreds of years for their signal to reach us, and a further few
    hundred years for our reply to reach them. It is not important, then, if there’s a delay of a few years, or decades,
    while the human race debates the question of whether to reply and perhaps carefully drafts a reply.

    <u>Reading Passage 03</u><br>
    <span style="font-size: smaller;">Questions <b>27 – 40</b></span>
  </h2>
  <h3>The history of the tortoise</h3>
  <p>
    If you go back far enough, everything lived in the sea. At various points in evolutionary history,
    enterprising individuals within many different animal groups moved out onto the land, sometimes even to
    the most parched deserts, taking their own private seawater with them in blood and cellular fluids. In
    addition to the reptiles, birds, mammals and insects which we see all around us, other groups that
    have succeeded out of water include scorpions, snails, crustaceans such as woodlice and land crabs,
    millipedes and centipedes, spiders and various worms. And we mustn’t forget the plants, without
    whose prior invasion of the land none of the other migrations could have happened.
  </p>
  <p>
    Moving from water to land involved a major redesign of every aspect of life, including breathing and
    reproduction. Nevertheless, a good number of thoroughgoing land animals later turned around, abandoned
    their hard-earned terrestrial re-tooling, and returned to the water again. Seals have only gone part way
    back. They show us what the intermediates might have been like, on the way to extreme cases such as
    whales and dugongs. Whales (including the small whales we call dolphins) and dugongs, with their close
    cousins the manatees, ceased to be land creatures altogether and reverted to the full marine habits of their
    remote ancestors. They don’t even come ashore to breed. They do, however, still breathe air, having never
    developed anything equivalent to the gills of their earlier marine incarnation. Turtles went back to the sea a
    very long time ago and, like all vertebrate returnees to the water, they breathe air. However, they are, in
    one respect, less fully given back to the water than whales or dugongs, for turtles still lay their eggs on
    beaches.
  </p>
  <p>
    There is evidence that all modem turtles are descended from a terrestrial ancestor which lived before most
    of the dinosaurs. There are two key fossils called Proganochelys quenstedti and Palaeochersis
    talampayensis dating from early dinosaur times, which appear to be close to the ancestry of all
    modem turtles and tortoises. You might wonder how we can tell whether fossil animals lived on land or in
    water, especially if only fragments are found. Sometimes it’s obvious. Ichthyosaurs were
    reptilian contemporaries of the dinosaurs, with fins and streamlined bodies. The fossils look like dolphins
    and they surely lived like dolphins, in the water. With turtles it is a little less obvious. One way to tell is
    by measuring the bones of their forelimbs.
  </p>
  <p>
    Walter Joyce and Jacques Gauthier, at Yale University, obtained three measurements in these particular
    bones of 71 species of living turtles and tortoises. They used a kind of triangular graph paper to plot the three
    measurements against one another. All the land tortoise species formed a tight cluster of points in the
    upper part of the triangle; all the water turtles cluster in the lower part of the triangular graph. There was
    no overlap, except when they added some species that spend time both in water and on land. Sure
    enough, these amphibious species show up on the triangular graph approximately half way between the
    ‘wet cluster’ of sea turtles and the ‘dry cluster’ of land tortoises. The next step was to determine where the
    fossils fell. The bones of P quenstedti and JR talampayensis leave us in no doubt. Their points on the graph
    are right in the thick of the dry cluster. Both these fossils were dry-land tortoises. They come from the
    era before our turtles returned to the water.
  </p>
  <p>
    You might think, therefore, that modem land tortoises have probably stayed on land ever since those early
    terrestrial times, as most mammals did after a few of them went back to the sea. But apparently not. If you
    draw out the family tree of all modem turtles and tortoises, nearly all the branches are aquatic.
    Today’s land tortoises constitute a single branch, deeply nested among branches consisting of aquatic
    turtles. This suggests that modem land tortoises have not stayed on land continuously since the time of
    P. quenstedti and P talampayensis. Rather, their ancestors were among those who went back to the water,
    and they then re-emerged back onto the land in (relatively) more recent times.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tortoises therefore represent a remarkable double return. In common with all mammals, reptiles and birds,
    their remote ancestors were marine fish and before that various more or less worm-like creatures stretching
    back, still in the sea, to the primeval bacteria. Later ancestors lived on land and stayed there for a very
    large number of generations. Later ancestors still evolved back into the water and became sea turtles. And
    finally they returned yet again to the land as tortoises, some of which now live in the driest of deserts.
