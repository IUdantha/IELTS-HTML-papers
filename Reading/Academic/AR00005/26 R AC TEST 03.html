    You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 1–13, which are based on the Reading Passage below:
  </p>
  <h3>The life and work of Marie Curie</h3>
  <p>
    Marie Curie is probably the most famous woman scientist who has ever lived. Born Maria Sklodowska in Poland in 1867,
    she is famous for her work on radioactivity, and was twice a winner of the Nobel Prize. With her husband, Pierre
    Curie and Henri Becquerel, she was awarded the 1903 Nobel Prize for Physics, and was then sole winner of the 1911
    Nobel Prize for Chemistry. She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize.
  </p>
  <p>
    From childhood, Marie was remarkable for her prodigious memory, and at the age of 16 won a gold medal on completion
    of her secondary education. Because her father lost his savings through bad investment, she then had to take work as
    a teacher. From her earnings, she was able to finance her sister Bronia's medical studies in Paris, on the
    understanding that Bronia would, in turn, later help her to get an education.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 1891 this promise was fulfilled and Marie went to Paris and began to study at the Sorbonne (the University of
    Paris). She often worked far into the night and lived on little more than bread and butter and tea. She came first
    in the examination in the physical sciences in 1893, and in 1894 was placed second in the examination in
    mathematical sciences. It was not until the spring of that year that she was introduced to Pierre Curie.
  </p>
  <p>
    Their marriage in 1895 marked the start of a partnership that was soon to achieve results of world significance.
    Following Henri Becquerel’s discovery in 1896 of a new phenomenon, which Marie later called "radioactivity", Marie
    Curie decided to find out if the radioactivity discovered in uranium was to be found in other elements. She
    discovered that this was true for thorium.
  </p>
  <p>
    Turning her attention to minerals, she found her interest drawn to pitchblende, a mineral whose radioactivity,
    superior to that of pure uranium, could be explained only by the presence in the ore of small quantities of an
    unknown substance of very high activity. Pierre Curie joined her in the work that she had undertaken to resolve this
    problem, and that led to the discovery of the new elements, polonium and radium. While Pierre Curie devoted himself
    chiefly to the physical study of the new radiations, Marie Curie struggled to obtain pure radium in the metallic
    state. This was achieved with the help of the chemist André-Louis Debierne, one of Pierre Curie's pupils. Based on
    the results of this research, Marie Curie received her Doctorate of Science, and in 1903 Marie and Pierre shared
    with Becquerel the Nobel Prize for Physics for the discovery of radioactivity.
  </p>
  <p>
    The births of Marie's two daughters, Irene and Eve, in 1897 and 1904 failed to interrupt her scientific work. She
    was appointed lecturer in physics at the École Normale Supérieure for girls in Sèvres, France (1900), and introduced
    a method of teaching based on experimental demonstrations. In December 1904 she was appointed chief assistant in the
    laboratory directed by Pierre Curie.
  </p>
  <p>
    The sudden death of her husband in 1906 was a bitter blow to Marie Curie, but was also a turning point in her
    career: henceforth she was to devote all her energy to completing alone the scientific work that they had
    undertaken. On May 19, 1906, she was appointed to the professorship that had been left vacant on her husband's
    death, becoming the first woman to teach at the Sorbonne. In 1911 she was awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry for
    the isolation of a pure form of radium.
  </p>
  <p>
    During World War I, Marie Curie, with the help of her daughter Irene, devoted herself to the development of the use
    of X‑radiography, including the mobile units which came to be known as "little Curies", used for the treatment of
    wounded soldiers. In 1918 the Radium Institute, whose staff Irene had joined, began to operate in earnest, and
    became a centre for nuclear physics and chemistry. Marie Curie, now at the highest point of her fame and, from 1922,
    a member of the Academy of Medicine, researched the chemistry of radioactive substances and their medical
    applications.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 1921, accompanied by her two daughters, Marie Curie made a triumphant journey to the United States to raise funds
    for research on radium. Women there presented her with a gram of radium for her campaign. Marie also gave lectures
    in Belgium, Brazil, Spain and Czechoslovakia and, in addition, had the satisfaction of seeing the development of the
    Curie Foundation in Paris and the inauguration in 1932 in Warsaw of the Radium Institute, where her sister Bronia
    became the director.
  </p>
  <p>
    One of Marie Curie's outstanding achievements was to have understood the need to accumulate intense radioactive
    sources, not only to treat illness but also to maintain an abundant supply for research. The existence in Paris at
    the Radium Institute of a stock of grams of radium made a decisive contribution to the success of the experiments
    undertaken in the years around 1930. This work prepared the way for the discovery of the neutron by Sir James
    Chadwick and, above all, for the discovery in 1934 by Irene and Frédéric Joliot‑Curie of artificial radioactivity. A
    few months after this discovery, Marie Curie died as a result of leukaemia caused by exposure to radiation. She had
    often carried test tubes containing radioactive isotopes in her pocket, remarking on the pretty blue‑green light
    they gave off.
  </p>
  <p>
    Her contribution to physics had been immense, not only in her own work—the importance of which had been demonstrated
    by her two Nobel Prizes—but because of her influence on subsequent generations of nuclear physicists and chemists.

    <span style="font-size: smaller; font-weight: bold;">Questions 14–26</span>
  </h2>
  <p>You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 14-26, which are based on the Reading Passage below:</p>
  <h3>The True Cost of Food</h3>
  <p>
    A  For more than forty years the cost of food has been rising. It has now reached a point where a growing number of people believe that it is far too high and that bringing it down will be one of the great challenges of the twenty‐first century. That cost, however, is not in immediate cash. In the West at least, most food is now far cheaper to buy in relative terms than it was in 1960. The cost is in the collateral damage of the very methods of food production that have made the food cheaper: in the pollution of water, the enervation of soil, the destruction of wildlife, the harm to animal welfare and the threat to human health caused by modern industrial agriculture.
  </p>
  <p>
    B  First mechanisation, then mass use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides, then monocultures, then battery rearing of livestock, and now genetic engineering– the onward march of intensive farming has seemed unstoppable in the last half‐century, as the yields of produce have soared. But the damage it has caused has been colossal. In Britain, for example, many of our best‐loved farmland birds, such as the skylark, the grey partridge, the lapwing and the corn bunting, have vanished from huge stretches of countryside, as have even more wild‐flowers and insects. This is a direct result of the way we have produced our food in the last four decades. Thousands of miles of hedgerows, thousands of ponds have disappeared from the landscape. The faecal filth of salmon farming has driven wild salmon from many of the sea lochs and rivers of Scotland. Natural soil fertility is dropping in many areas because of continuous industrial fertiliser and pesticide use, while the growth of algae is increasing in lakes because of the fertiliser run‐off.
  </p>
  <p>
    C  Put it all together and it looks like a battlefield, but consumers rarely make the connection at the dinner table. That is mainly because the costs of all this damage are what economists refer to as externalities: they are outside the main transaction, which is, for example, producing and selling a field of wheat, and are borne directly by neither producers nor consumers. To many, the costs may not even appear to be financial at all, but merely aesthetic – a terrible shame, but nothing to do with money. And anyway, they, as consumers of food, certainly aren't paying for it, are they?
  </p>
  <p>
    D  But the costs to society can actually be quantified and, when added up, can amount to staggering sums. A remarkable exercise in doing this has been carried out by one of the world's leading thinkers on the future of agriculture, Professor Jules Pretty, Director of the Centre for Environment and Society at the University of Essex. Professor Pretty and his colleagues calculated the externalities of British agriculture for one particular year. They added up the costs of repairing the damage it caused and came up with a total figure of £2,343m. This is equivalent to £208 for every hectare of arable land and permanent pasture, almost as much again as the total government and EU spends on British farming in that year. And according to Professor Pretty, it was a conservative estimate.
  </p>
  <p>
    E  The costs included: £120m for removal of pesticides; £16m for removal of nitrates; £55m for removal of phosphates and soil; £23m for the removal of the bug cryptosporidium from drinking water by water companies; £125m for damage to wildlife habitats, hedgerows and dry stone walls; £1,113m from emissions of gases likely to contribute to climate change; £106m from soil erosion and organic carbon losses; £169m from food poisoning; and £607m from cattle disease. Professor Pretty draws a simple but memorable conclusion from all this: our food bills are actually threefold. We are paying for our supposedly cheaper food in three separate ways: once over the counter, secondly through our taxes, which provide the enormous subsidies propping up modern intensive farming, and thirdly to clean up the mess that modern farming leaves behind.
  </p>
  <p>
    F  So can the true cost of food be brought down? Breaking away from industrial agriculture as the solution to hunger may be very hard for some countries, but in Britain, where the immediate need to supply food is less urgent, and the costs and the damage of intensive farming have been clearly seen, it may be more feasible. The government needs to create sustainable, competitive and diverse farming and food sectors, which will contribute to a thriving and sustainable rural economy, and advance environmental, economic, health, and animal welfare goals.
  </p>
  <p>
    G  But if industrial agriculture is to be replaced, what is a viable alternative? Professor Pretty feels that organic farming would be too big a jump in thinking and in practices for many farmers. Furthermore, the price premium would put the product out of reach of many poorer consumers. He is recommending the immediate introduction of a "Greener Food Standard", which would push the market towards more sustainable environmental practices than the current norm, while not requiring the full commitment to organic production. Such a standard would comprise agreed practices for different kinds of farming, covering agrochemical use, soil health, land management, water and energy use, food safety and animal health. It could go a long way, he says, to shifting consumers as well as farmers towards a more sustainable system of agriculture.

  <h3>Makete Integrated Rural Transport Project</h3>
  <p>
    The disappointing results of many conventional road transport projects in Africa led some experts to rethink the strategy by which rural transport problems were to be tackled at the beginning of the 1980s. A request for help in improving the availability of transport within the remote Makete District of southwestern Tanzania presented the opportunity to try a new approach.
  </p>
  <p>
    The concept of "integrated rural transport" was adopted in the task of examining the transport needs of the rural households in the district. The objective was to reduce the time and effort needed to obtain access to essential goods and services – through an improved rural transport system. The underlying assumption was that the time saved would be used instead for activities that would improve the social and economic development of the communities. The Makete Integrated Rural Transport–Project (MIRTP) started in 1985 with financial support from the Swiss Development Corporation and was coordinated with the help of the Tanzanian government.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Section B</strong><br>
    When the project began Makete District was virtually totally isolated during the rainy season. The regional road was in such bad shape that access to the main towns was impossible for about three months of the year. Road traffic was extremely rare within the district, and alternative means of transport were restricted to donkeys in the north of the district, as people relied primarily on the paths, which were slippery and dangerous during the rains.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before solutions could be proposed, the problems had to be understood. Little was known about the transport demands of the rural households, so Phase I, between December 1985 and December 1987, focused on research. The socio-economic survey of more than 400 households in the district indicates that a household in Makete spent, on average, seven hours a day on transporting themselves and their goods, a figure which seemed extreme but which has also been obtained in surveys in other rural areas in Africa.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Section C</strong><br>
    Having determined the main transport needs, possible solutions were identified which might reduce the time and burden. During Phase II, from January to February 1991, a number of approaches were implemented in an effort to improve mobility and access to transport. An improvement of the rotten network was considered necessary to ensure the import and export of goods to the district. These improvements were carried out using methods that were heavily dependent on labour. In addition to the improvement of roads, these methods provided training in the operation of a mechanical workshop and bus and truck services. However, the difference from the conventional approach was that this time consideration was given to local transport needs outside the road network.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Section D</strong><br>
    At the end of Phase II, it was clear that the selected approaches to Makete's transport problems had had different degrees of success. Phase III, from March 1991 to March 1993, focused on the refinement of most of these activities.
  </p>
  <p>
    The road improvements and accompanying maintenance system had helped make the district centre accessible throughout the year. Essential goods from outside the district had become more readily available at the market and prices did not fluctuate as much as they had done before.
  </p>
  <p>
    Paths and secondary roads were improved only at the request of locals who were willing to participate in construction and maintenance. However, the improved paths impressed the inhabitants, and requests for assistance greatly increased soon after only a few improvements had been completed.
  </p>
  <p>
    The efforts to improve the efficiency of the existing transport services were not very successful because most of the motorised vehicles in the district broke down and there were no resources to repair them. Even the introduction of low-cost means of transport was difficult because of the general poverty of the district. The locally manufactured wheelbarrows were still too expensive for all but a few of the households. Modifications to the original design by local carpenters cut production time and costs. Other local carpenters have been trained in the new design so that they can respond to requests. Nevertheless, a locally produced wooden wheelbarrow which costs around 500 Tanzanian shillings (less than US$20) in Makete, and is about one-quarter the cost of a metal wheelbarrow, is still too expensive for most people.
  </p>
  <p>
    Donkeys, which were imported to the district, have become more common and contribute, in particular, to the transportation of crops and goods to market. Those who have bought donkeys are mainly from richer households but with an increased supply through local breeding, donkeys should become more affordable. Meanwhile, local initiatives are promoting the renting out of the existing donkeys.
  </p>
  <p>
    It should be noted, however, that a donkey, which at 20,000 Tanzanian shillings costs less than a bicycle, is still an investment equal to an average household's income over half a year. This dearly illustrates the need for supplementary measures if one wants to assist the rural poor.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Section E</strong><br>
    It would have been easy to criticize the MIRTP for using in the early phases a top-down approach, in which decisions were made by experts and officials before being handed down to communities, but it was necessary to start the process from the level of the governmental authorities of the district. It would have been difficult to respond to the requests of villagers and other rural inhabitants without the support and understanding of district authorities.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Section F</strong><br>
    Today, nobody in the district argues about the importance of improved paths and inexpensive means of transport. But this is the result of dedicated work over a long period, particularly from the officers in charge of community development. They played an essential role in raising awareness and interest among the rural communities.
  </p>
  <p>
    The concept of integrated rural transport is now well established in Tanzania, where a major program of rural transport is just about to start. The experiences from Makete will help in this initiative, and Makete District will act as a reference for future work.
