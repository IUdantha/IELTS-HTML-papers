    </h2>
    <h3 style="margin:10px 0;">BORDER CROSSING FOR COMMERCIAL VEHICLES</h3>
    <p style="margin:10px 0;">
      This Border Crossing Guide is designed for drivers and motor carriers operating commercial vehicles at Michigan’s international border crossings. This information will help you cross the border from the US into Canada, and from Canada into the US.
    </p>
    <p style="margin:10px 0;">
      Your first point of contact at the border consists of Primary Inspection. The best way to clear customs is to ensure Customs gets information about your shipment before you set off, using the Pre-Arrival Processing System (PAPS). When using this system, you need to provide information about your shipment and send proof of a current annual inspection for your vehicle, tractor, and trailer.
    </p>
    <p style="margin:10px 0;">
      Before you arrive at the border, make sure you have all your paperwork up to date and ready to present at Primary Inspection. You’ll need a photo ID in addition to your birth certificate or passport. Drivers must also turn on interior cab lights and open all interior drapes or blinds to sleeper areas for easy inspection.
    </p>
    <p style="margin:10px 0;">
      If your paperwork is in order and processed ahead of time, you will be released at the primary lane and this may be your only stop. If you are not a Canadian or US citizen, a visa is obligatory and you will be required to complete an I-94 card (available only at border crossings into the United States). Drivers who clear customs at Primary Inspection will be instructed to report to Immigration to fill out the I-94 card and receive verbal clearance to proceed into the United States. The charge for the I-94 card is $6.
    </p>
    <p style="margin:10px 0;">
      If your paperwork is not in order, you will be directed to Secondary Inspection. Look for the signs for Truck Inspection and follow these instructions.

    </h2>
    <h3 style="margin:10px 0;">Appendix: Dealing with absence in the workplace</h3>
    <p style="margin:10px 0;">
      This appendix considers how to handle problems of absence and gives guidance about the authorised and unauthorised absence of employees from work. The organisation should be aware of the rights of employees – for example, under the Equality Act 2010 – when making decisions about absences of disabled employees. Employers should consider reasonable adjustments such as supplying an appropriate chair for the employee or, in cases of allergies, remedial action or a transfer to alternative work.
    </p>
    <p style="margin:10px 0;">
      If absence is due to temporary difficulties with dependants, the employee may be entitled to time off under the Employment Rights Act 1996. Employees with difficulty managing work and home responsibilities have the right to request flexible working arrangements, such as job-sharing, provided there is a good business reason for any rejection.
    </p>
    <p style="margin:10px 0;">
      Employers should investigate unexpected absences promptly and ask for an explanation at a return-to-work interview. Persistent absence should be dealt with firmly and consistently, with records kept of lateness and durations. If an employer wishes to contact an employee’s doctor for more details about a medical condition, written notification and consent are required. Measures should also be introduced to help employees suffering from stress.
    </p>

      <span style="font-size: smaller; font-weight: bold;">Questions 28–40</span>
    </h2>
    <h3 style="margin:10px 0;">A visit to Oymyakon, the world’s coldest town</h3>
    
    <!-- Paragraphs A-I -->
    <p style="margin:10px 0;"><strong>Paragraph A:</strong> You don’t need a sat nav to drive to Oymyakon. From Yakutsk, you cross the Lena River and simply follow the M56 almost all of the way before taking a left at Tomtor for the final few kilometres. The journey takes two days of hard driving; two days of glistening landscapes, frozen rivers and untouched snow; two days of endless forest and breathtaking beauty; two days to penetrate the heart of Siberia and reach the coldest inhabited place on Earth. The beauty surprised me. Siberia isn’t known for its pleasant appearance. It’s always billed as a place of hardship. But for hour after hour, the wintry wonderland was bathed in a crisp, clean sunshine, presenting a continuous panorama of conifer trees wreathed in silence and snow.
    </p>
    <p style="margin:10px 0;"><strong>Paragraph B:</strong> As we left the flat plain, the road began to twist and turn, leading us into untouched hills and on towards the Verkhoyansk Mountains. Beneath their snow-clad peaks, the slopes became steeper and the valleys deeper. Down in a valley, we stopped to look at a hot spring beside the road. It was immediately obvious against the snow – a spot shrouded in heavy mist. Trees emerged from the strange haze as ghostly silhouettes.
    </p>
    <p style="margin:10px 0;"><strong>Paragraph C:</strong> Despite the magical ambience of the Siberian wilderness, its reputation for hardship hit me every time I climbed out of the vehicle. Within less than a minute, the skin all over my face began to feel as if it were burning. If I wasn’t wearing my two sets of gloves, I rapidly lost the feeling in my fingertips. I learned very quickly not to draw too deep a breath because the shock of the cold air in my lungs invariably set me off on an extended bout of coughing. Siberia in winter is a world barely fit for human habitation. This is a place of such searing cold that it bites through multiple layers of clothing as if they aren’t there.
    </p>
    <p style="margin:10px 0;"><strong>Paragraph D:</strong> Oymyakon is a quiet little town – the world’s coldest – of about 550 inhabitants, with its own power station, a school, two shops and a small hospital. It probably originated as a seasonal settlement where reindeer herders spent the summer on the banks of the Indigirka River.
    </p>
    <p style="margin:10px 0;"><strong>Paragraph E:</strong> The temperature when I arrived was -45°C – not particularly cold, I was informed. A number of factors combine to explain Oymyakon’s record low temperatures. It is far from the ocean, with its moderating effect on air temperature. In addition, the town sits in a valley, below the general level of the Oymyakon Plateau, which, in turn, is enclosed on all sides by mountains up to 2,000 metres in height. As the cold air sinks, it accumulates in the valley, with little wind to disturb it. Oymyakon’s average temperature in January is -50°C. Lower temperatures have been recorded in Antarctica, but there are no permanent inhabitants there.
    </p>
    <p style="margin:10px 0;"><strong>Paragraph F:</strong> Day-to-day life in Oymyakon presents certain challenges during the long winters. There are hardly any modern household conveniences. Water is hacked out of the nearby river as great chunks of ice and dragged home on a sledge. The giant ice cubes are stacked outdoors and carried into the house one at a time to melt when needed. The lack of running water also means no showers or baths, or indeed flushing toilets. Since 2008, the town’s school has enjoyed the luxury of indoor toilets, however. It’s one of the few civic buildings in the centre of town linked to the power station.
    </p>
    <p style="margin:10px 0;"><strong>Paragraph G:</strong> The power station provides winter heating in the form of hot water, but many houses lie outside its range and rely on their own wood-burning stove. Fuel is plentiful in the surrounding forest, but someone still has to venture out to cut the wood. Everybody in Oymyakon owns good boots, a hat made of animal fur, and fur-lined mittens. The boots are usually made from reindeer hide, which is light but keeps your feet very warm – the individual hairs are hollow, like a thin tube with air inside. Since air is a poor conductor of heat, the skin makes excellent winter footwear, and felt soles give added insulation. Hats come in a variety of furs, including fox, raccoon, sable and mink.
    </p>
    <p style="margin:10px 0;"><strong>Paragraph H:</strong> Oymyakon’s two shops keep a decent stock of basic foods in tins and packets, but locals also have do-it-yourself options including hunting, trapping, ice-fishing, reindeer-breeding, and horse-breeding. Indeed, being self-sufficient runs in the blood in Siberia. The Oymyakon diet relies heavily on meat for its protein, a primary source of energy in the prolonged winter. A typical meal I was offered consisted of a thick horse soup and huge piles of horse meatballs, all washed down with cloudberry cordial.
    </p>
    <p style="margin:10px 0;"><strong>Paragraph I:</strong> Spring is the best season here, I’m told. The snow melts, the river flows once more and the forest is full of wildflowers. But it’s short. In the summer Oymyakon can be uncomfortably hot. Much of the forest becomes boggy, so mosquitoes are a constant presence. Oymyakon’s climate certainly wouldn’t suit me, but residents say they wouldn’t live anywhere else.
