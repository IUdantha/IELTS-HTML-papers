    <h3 style="margin: 10px 0;">Is Your Child at School Today?</h3>
    <p style="font-weight: bold; margin: 10px 0;">School Attendance Information for Parents/Carers</p>

    <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br>
      Receiving a good full-time education will give your child the best possible start in life. 
      Attending school regularly and punctually is essential if children are to make the most of 
      the opportunities available to them. The law says that parents must ensure that their child 
      regularly attends the school where he/she is registered.
    </p>

    <p style="font-weight: bold; margin: 10px 0;">What you can do to help</p>
    <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
      <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
        Make sure your child arrives at school on time. This encourages habits of good timekeeping 
        and lessens any possible classroom disruption. If your child arrives after the register has 
        closed without a good reason, this will be recorded as an ‘unauthorised’ absence for that session.
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
        If your child has to miss school it is vital that you let the school know why, preferably 
        on the first morning of absence. (Your child’s school will have an attendance policy 
        explaining how this should be done.)
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
        If you know or think that your child is having difficulties attending the school you should 
        contact the school. It is better to do this sooner rather than later, as most problems can 
        be dealt with very quickly.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p style="font-weight: bold; margin: 10px 0;">Authorised and Unauthorised Absence</p>
    <p>
      If your child is absent and the school either does not receive an explanation from you, or 
      considers the explanation unsatisfactory, it will record your child’s absence as 
      ‘unauthorised’, that is, as truancy.
    </p>
    <p>Most absences for acceptable reasons will be authorised by your child’s school:</p>
    <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
      <li>Sickness</li>
      <li>Unavoidable medical or dental appointments (if possible, arrange these for after school or during school holidays)</li>
      <li>An interview with a prospective employer or college</li>
      <li>Exceptional family circumstances, such as bereavement</li>
      <li>Days of religious observance.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Your child’s school will not authorise absence for the following reasons:</p>
    <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
      <li>Shopping during school hours</li>
      <li>Day trips</li>
      <li>Holidays which have not been agreed</li>
      <li>Birthdays</li>
      <li>Looking after brothers or sisters or ill relatives.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 style="margin: 10px 0;">GZJ TRAVEL – Recruitment Info</h4>
    <p>
      We’re looking for keen and effective people who are passionate about travel to work as 
      Travel Sales Consultants in our rapidly-growing team. Our recruitment process has five 
      stages. Here’s how it works:
    </p>
    <p>
      The first stage is to use our online application form to apply for a current vacancy. This 
      is your chance to tell us about yourself, and the qualities and experience you have that 
      make you the ideal person for the job. For the Travel Sales Consultant role, you’ll need 
      to provide us with evidence that you have extensive experience in a marketing environment, 
      as well as a solid academic background. If you’re interested in a career as a Corporate 
      Travel Consultant, you’ll need at least one year’s experience as a Travel Consultant.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you reach Stage Two, we’ll arrange a telephone discussion, where you can find out more 
      about us, including the rewards on offer. For instance, once a year we like to acknowledge 
      outstanding efforts and celebrate successes with our co-workers, and we have prize-giving 
      ceremonies designed to do just this.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Stage Three we’ll be able to give you more information about GZJ Travel and find out 
      more about you, at an interview which you’ll attend with a small group of other applicants. 
      We’ll be asking you about your ambitions and of course your sales ability, the most vital 
      quality for our business. You’ll also be required to complete a psychometric test so we can 
      find out more about your working style and characteristics. We’ll also tell you about some of 
      the perks – for example, as a Flight Center employee you can take advantage of the free 
      consultations conducted by our in-house health and wellbeing team, Healthwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, in Stage Four, you’ll be introduced to the Area Leader and you’ll also visit one of our 
      shops, where you’ll meet the team and find out more about the sort of work that’s involved. 
      If you successfully pass Stage Four, you’ve reached the final stage of the process and we’ll be 
      in touch with a job offer! And if you accept, we’ll book you into our Learning Center to get 
      your training underway as soon as possible. Careerwise, the department responsible for the 
      training, will then organise individual coaching to assist in setting goals for your career path.

    <p style="font-weight: bold; margin: 10px 0;">Health and safety in the workplace</p>

    <p><strong>Personal safety</strong><br>
      You must be familiar with the emergency procedures in your building so that you know 
      what to do in the event of fire, spillages or other accidents. Do not enter restricted areas 
      without authorisation, and at all times observe the warnings given. Do not wedge open fire 
      doors or tamper with door closures, and do not block doorways, corridors or stairs, as 
      ob-structions may affect access in the event of a fire. Avoid leaving drawers and doors 
      open unnecessarily and do not trail cables or flexes across the floor.
    </p>
    <p><strong>How to dispose of rubbish safely</strong><br>
      We aim to protect the environment by saving and recycling glass, waste paper, and an 
      increasing range of other materials. It is important to check materials carefully for 
      con-tamination before placing them in recycling containers. Never put sharp objects such 
      as razor blades or broken glass into waste bins without having wrapped the items 
      carefully to protect those emptying the bins. Other waste procedures may vary – contact 
      your Building Manager or Divisional Safety Officer for advice with regard to your 
      particular department.
    </p>
    <p><strong>How to handle heavy objects</strong><br>
      Make sure that shelves are not overloaded and that glass and heavy objects are stored at 
      working height where they will be easier to reach. Use steps or ladders to reach items at 
      height; never climb on benches, tables or chairs. Never move anything that is beyond 
      your capability. Wherever possible you should use the trolleys provided in the workplace 
      to do the job for you. If repetitive manual operations are routine in your work, your 
      department will ensure you receive appropriate instruction on safe working practices 
      and posture.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Staying alert</strong><br>
      If you become mentally or physically tired during the working day, and find that you’re 
      feeling drowsy or not concentrating properly, you could be at risk of causing an accident 
      or making a mistake that could harm you or your colleagues. To prevent this, make sure 
      that you take regular breaks when necessary.

    <p style="margin: 10px 0; font-weight: bold;">The Zebras’ long walk across Africa</p>
    <p>James Gifford investigates some interesting new research into migration patterns of zebras living in Botswana in southern Africa.</p>

    <p><strong>A.</strong><br>
    For any animal to travel over 270 km in Botswana partly across the sand and low bush terrain of the Kalahari Desert is a remarkable achievement. But to do so in 11 days and without any obvious motivation, as this zebra population does, is quite extraordinary. On average their journey involves an exhausting round-trip of 588 km – between the Makgadikgadi salt pan area and the Okavango river – making it second only to the great trek undertaken by the zebra herds in the Serengeti National Park. However, what is even more incredible still in my view is that until recently it was completely unheard of.</p>

    <p><strong>B.</strong><br>
    Hattie Bartlam, a researcher, discovered this migration while she was tracking zebra groups, officially known as harems, by the Okavango River for her PhD, Each harem consists of a stallion and his seven or eight mares with juvenile foals. There is no loyalty between zebras beyond this social group, though harems often gather together into so-called herds. For her study, Hattie had planned to compare the small-scale movement patterns of 11 different zebra herds in the area.</p>

    <p><strong>C.</strong><br>
    In December, when the annual rains had transformed the roads into rivers, Hattie was, therefore, more than a little surprised when she checked the data sent by the radio collars she fits to the zebras she is tracking to find that six of the harems were 270 km away on the edge of the Makgadikgadi, a huge mineral-rich area where salt has collected over the years as water evaporates in the heat. Then, when the last of the moisture from the rains had disappeared in May the following year, five of those harems came wearily back to the Okavango. This raised the question: why, despite a plentiful supply of food and water, were the zebras being drawn eastwards to the salt pans? Even more difficult to understand was what made six of the groups travel so far, while the other five remained by the Okavango.</p>

    <p><strong>D.</strong><br>
    This discovery created quite a buzz in the research community. I decided to visit Hattie and she explained that a century ago the large number of Botswana’s zebra and wildebeest herds and the resulting competition for grass made migration essential. One of the migration tracks went from the Okavango to Makgadikgadi. But in the late 1960s, giant fences were put up to stop foot and mouth and other diseases spreading between wildlife and domestic cattle. One of these went across the migration track. Though the animals could get round the obstacle, each leg of their journey would now be 200 km longer – an impossible distance given the lack of permanent water on the extended route. Even today, with the fence gone (it was taken down in 2004), there is dangerously little drinking water to support the zebras on the return journey to the Okavango.</p>

    As a zebra can live up to 20 years, the migration must have skipped at least one generation during the 40 or so years that the fences were up. This prompts another question: it has always been assumed that the young of social herbivores like zebras learn migratory behaviour from their parents, so how did the latest generation learn when and where to go? Not from their parents, who were prevented from migrating. Did they follow another species, such as elephants? We may never know.</p>

    Hattie’s data points to the conclusion that there are several zebra populations adopting different behaviour. The first, like the vast majority of the Okavango zebras, take it easy, spending the entire year by the river. The second group, 15,000-20,000 strong, work a bit harder. They divide their time between the Makgadikgadi salt pans and the Boteti River, which is reasonably nearby. They sometimes struggle to find water in the Boteti area during the dry season, often moving 30 km in search of fresh grazing. Their reward: the juicy grass around the Makgadikgadi after the rains. The final group of zebras, whose numbers are more modest (though as yet unknown), must surely be considered as among the animal kingdom’s most remarkable athletes. By moving between the Okavango and the salt pans, they enjoy the best of both worlds. But the price they pay is an extraordinary journey across Botswana.</p>

    Endangered species naturally tend to grab the headlines, so it’s refreshing for a relatively abundant animal like the zebra to be the centre of attention for once. Zebras are a vital part of the food chain: understanding their migration, in turn, helps us to interpret the movements of their predators, and Hattie’s research has shed light on the impact of fences on migratory animals. So what triggered her interest in zebras? She explains that it is easier to get funding to study exciting animals like lions. Crucial as that undoubtedly is, she believes that herbivores like zebras are key to understanding any ecosystem. The scientific community is fortunate that people like Hattie are willing to take the hard option.</p>

    <p><em>Social behaviour in zebras</em><br>
    Zebras tend to live together in small units, which experts call <input type="text" style="width: 100px; height: 20px;" placeholder="(Answer)">. 
    Here, a male zebra has charge of a number of adult <input type="text" style="width: 100px; height: 20px;" placeholder="(Answer)"> and their young. 
    These units sometimes assemble in bigger groupings or <input type="text" style="width: 100px; height: 20px;" placeholder="(Answer)">, but it is still 
    clear that the zebras’ loyalty only extends to the small unit they live in.</p>

    <p><strong>38.</strong> How did Hattie feel when she heard some of the zebras had travelled so far?<br>
      <label><input type="radio" name="q38" value="A" style="margin-right: 5px;">A. annoyed because she would have to follow them to Makgadikgadi</label><br>
      <label><input type="radio" name="q38" value="B" style="margin-right: 5px;">B. disappointed that not all of them made it back to Okavango</label><br>
      <label><input type="radio" name="q38" value="C" style="margin-right: 5px;">C. frustrated as the rains had made the roads unusable</label><br>
      <label><input type="radio" name="q38" value="D" style="margin-right: 5px;">D. unsure as to their real motivation for going</label>
    </p>
    <p><strong>39.</strong> When describing the different Botswana zebra populations, the writer indicates<br>
      <label><input type="radio" name="q39" value="A" style="margin-right: 5px;">A. his admiration for the ones who migrate the furthest distance.</label><br>
      <label><input type="radio" name="q39" value="B" style="margin-right: 5px;">B. his sympathy for the ones who stay by the Okavango River.</label><br>
      <label><input type="radio" name="q39" value="C" style="margin-right: 5px;">C. his disbelief that those by the Boteti have difficulty finding food.</label><br>
      <label><input type="radio" name="q39" value="D" style="margin-right: 5px;">D. his anxiety that their migration patterns may not be able to continue.</label>
    </p>
    <p><strong>40.</strong> What does the writer suggest in the final paragraph?<br>
      <label><input type="radio" name="q40" value="A" style="margin-right: 5px;">A. Too much time has been wasted on research into the predators like lions.</label><br>
      <label><input type="radio" name="q40" value="B" style="margin-right: 5px;">B. it is sometimes necessary to go against the trend in research matters.</label><br>
      <label><input type="radio" name="q40" value="C" style="margin-right: 5px;">C. Research will result in a ban on fences in areas where zebras live.</label><br>
      <label><input type="radio" name="q40" value="D" style="margin-right: 5px;">D. Research into animals which are not endangered will increase.</label>
