      <h3 style="margin-top:10px;">BIG ROCK CLIMBING CENTRE</h3>
      <p style="margin:5px 0;">Big Rock Climbing Centre is a modern, friendly professionally run centre offering over 1,200 square metres of fantastic indoor climbing. We use trained and experienced instructors to give you the opportunity to learn and develop climbing skills, keep fit and have fun. Master our 11 m-high climbing walls using a rope harness, for an unbeatable sense of achievement. Or experience the thrills of climbing without any harness in our special low-level arena, which has foam mats on the floor to cushion any fall safety.</p>
      <p style="margin:5px 0;">Who is Big Rock for?<br>
      Almost anyone can enjoy Big Rock. Previous climbing experience and specialist equipment are not required. You can come on your own or with friends and family. It comes as a fun alternative to the gym or for a special day out with the kids. If you're visiting with friends or family but not climbing, or just fancy coming to look, please feel free to relax in our excellent cafe overlooking the climbing areas.</p>
      <p style="margin:5px 0;">Mobile Climbing Wall<br>
      Available on a day hire basis at any location, the Big Rock Mobile Climbing Wall is the perfect way to enhance any show, festival or event. The mobile wall can be used indoors or outdoors and features four unique 7.3 m-high climbing faces designed to allow four people to climb simultaneously. Quick to set up and pack up, the mobile climbing wall is staffed by qualified and experienced climbing instructors, providing the opportunity to climb the wall in a controlled and safe environment. When considering what to wear, we've found that trousers and t-shirts are ideal. We will however, ask people to remove scarves. Most flat shoes are suitable as long as they are enclosed and support the foot. The mobile wall is very adaptable and can be operated in light rain and winds up to 50 kph. There are however, particular measures that we take in such conditions.</p>
      <p style="margin:5px 0;">What about hiring the Mobile Climbing Wall for my school or college?<br>
      As climbing is different from the usual team games practiced at schools, we've found that some students who don’t usually like participating in sports are willing to have a go on the mobile climbing wall. If you're concerned that some children may not want to take part because they feel nervous if they climb, then please be assured that our instructors will support them up to a level which they're comfortable with. They will still benefit greatly from the experience.</p>

      <p>You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 15-27, which are based on Reading Passages below.</p>
      <h3 style="margin-top:10px;">Read the text below and answer Questions 15-20.</h3>
      <h4 style="margin:5px 0;">Marketing advice for new businesses</h4>
      <p style="margin:5px 0;">If you’re setting up your own business, here’s some advice on getting customers.</p>
      <p style="margin:5px 0;"><strong>Know where your customers look</strong><br>
         Your customers aren’t necessarily where you think they are. So if you’re advertising where they’re just not looking, it’s wasted money. That’s why it pays to do a bit of research. Every time someone contacts your company, ask them where they found out about you. And act on this information so you’re advertising in the right places.
      </p>
      <p style="margin:5px 0;"><strong>Always think like a customer</strong><br>
         What makes your customers tick? Find out, and you’re halfway to saying the right things in your advertising. So take the time to ask them. A simple phone or email survey of your own customers, politely asking why they use you, what they really like and what they don’t, is invaluable.
      </p>
      <p style="margin:5px 0;"><strong>Make sure customers know you’re there</strong><br>
         If a customer can't see you, they can't buy from you. There are loads of opportunities to promote your business — print, press, direct mail, telemarketing, email and the internet — and using a mix of these increases your chances of being seen (and remembered).
      </p>
      <p style="margin:5px 0;"><strong>Ignore your customers and they’ll go away</strong><br>
         It sounds obvious, but companies who talk to their customers have much better retention rates than those that don’t, so it’s worth staying in touch. Capture your customers’ email addresses upfront. Follow up a transaction to check they’re happy with the service and, if possible, send them updates that are helpful, informative and relevant.
      </p>
      <p style="margin:5px 0;"><strong>Know what works (and what doesn’t)</strong><br>
         Do what the professionals do, and measure all your advertising. That’ll tell you what you’re doing right - and where there’s room for improvement. You never know, it might just throw up some information that could change your business for the better.
      </p>
      <p style="margin:5px 0;"><strong>Remember word-of-mouth: the best advertising there is</strong><br>
         A recent survey found that consumers are 50% more likely to be influenced by word-of-mouth recommendations than by TV or radio ads. So your reputation is your greatest asset. If your current customers are impressed with your company, they’ll be more inclined to recommend you to others. On the flip side, if they experience bad service they probably won’t complain to you - but you can be sure they will to their friends.

      <h3 style="margin-top:10px;">Working Time Regulations for Mobile Workers</h3>
      <p style="margin:5px 0;">These rules apply to drivers and crew of heavy goods vehicles or public service vehicles. The rules limit the amount of time that can be worked. Those defined in the Regulations as being self-employed are currently not covered by the Regulations.</p>
      <p style="margin:5px 0;"><strong>What are the limits?</strong></p>
      <ul style="margin-left:20px; padding-left:0;">
        <li>An average of 48 hours' work per week.</li>
        <li>In any single week up to 60 hours can be worked so long as the 48-hour average is maintained.</li>
        <li>Night work is limited to 10 hours per night, unless there is a workforce agreement to work longer.</li>
        <li>Statutory annual leave and any sick leave and/or maternity/paternity leave counts as working time.</li>
      </ul>
      <p style="margin:5px 0;"><strong>What counts as work?</strong> In general, any activity performed in connection with the transport operation counts as work, for example, driving, loading/unloading and those checks that are the responsibility of drivers, such as checking lights, brakes, etc. There are a number of periods of time that do not count as work, for example, travelling between home and your normal place of work, lunch or other breaks and periods of availability.</p>
      <p style="margin:5px 0;">Periods of availability are periods of time during which the mobile worker is not required to remain at their workstation but is required to be available for work, the foreseeable duration of which is known about in advance, for example:</p>
      <ul style="margin-left:20px; padding-left:0;">
        <li>Delays at a distribution centre.</li>
        <li>Reporting for work then being informed that no duties are to be undertaken for a specified period.</li>
        <li>Accompanying a vehicle being transported, for example by train.</li>
      </ul>
      <p style="margin:5px 0;">A period of availability can be taken at the workstation. Providing the worker has a reasonable amount of freedom (e.g. they can read and relax) for a known duration, this could satisfy the requirements of a period of availability.</p>
      <p style="margin:5px 0;">Situations when a period of time should not be recorded as a period of availability:</p>
      <ul style="margin-left:20px; padding-left:0;">
        <li>Hold-ups due to congestion, because the driver would be stopping and starting the vehicle.</li>
        <li>Frequently moving up within a queue (e.g. waiting within a queue to load or unload) every other minute.</li>
      </ul>
      <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-top:10px;">Questions 21-27</p>
      <p>Complete the notes below. Choose <strong>ONE WORD ONLY</strong> from the text for each answer. Write your answers in boxes 21-27 on your answer sheet.</p>
      <ol style="margin-left:20px;">
        <li>These apply to people working on lorries, buses, etc. They don't apply to 
          <input type="text" name="q21" style="width:120px; margin-left:10px;"> workers.
        </li>
        <li>Maximum working hours: 60 hours a week, provided the 
          <input type="text" name="q22" style="width:120px; margin-left:10px;"> is no more than 48 hours.
        </li>
        <li>Night work can be more than 10 hours with the 
          <input type="text" name="q23" style="width:120px; margin-left:10px;"> of the workers.
        </li>
        <li>Work includes driving, loading and unloading, and carrying out various 
          <input type="text" name="q24" style="width:120px; margin-left:10px;"> of the vehicle.
        </li>
        <li>Periods of availability include: going on a 
          <input type="text" name="q25" style="width:120px; margin-left:10px;"> or other form of transport with a vehicle.
        </li>
        <li>A period at the workstation when the driver has some 
          <input type="text" name="q26" style="width:120px; margin-left:10px;"> might count as a period of availability.
        </li>
        <li>Periods of availability exclude: time spent stopping and starting the vehicle when 
          <input type="text" name="q27" style="width:120px; margin-left:10px;"> causes delays being in a queue, e.g. in order to load or unload.

      <h3 style="margin-top:10px;">What is it like to run a large supermarket?</h3>
      <p style="font-weight: bold;">Jill Insley finds out</p>
      <p style="margin:0;"><strong>A:</strong> You can’t beat really good service. I’ve been shopping in the Thamesmead branch of supermarket chain Morrisons, in south-east London, and I’ve experienced at first hand, the store’s latest maxim for improving the shopping experience &ndash; help, offer, thank. This involves identifying customers who might need help, greeting them, asking what they need, providing it, thanking them and leaving them in peace. If they don’t look like they want help, they’ll be left alone. But if they’re standing looking lost and perplexed, a member of staff will approach them. Staff are expected to be friendly to everyone. My checkout assistant has certainly said something to amuse the woman in front of me, she’s smiling as she leaves. Adrian Perriss, manager of the branch, has discussed the approach with each of his 387 staff. He says it’s about recognising that someone needs help, not being a nuisance to them. When he’s in another store, he’s irritated by someone saying, ‘Can I help you?’ when he’s only just walked in to have a quick look at the products.</p>
      <p style="margin:0;"><strong>B:</strong> How anyone can be friendly and enthusiastic when they start work at dawn beats me. The store opens at 7 am, Monday to Saturday, meaning that some staff, including Perriss, have to be here at 6 am to make sure it’s clean, safe and stocked up for the morning rush. Sometimes he walks in at 6 am and thinks they’re never going to be ready on time, but they always are. There’s so much going on overnight &ndash; 20 people working on unloading three enormous trailers full of groceries.</p>
      <p style="margin:0;"><strong>C:</strong> Perriss has worked in supermarkets since 1982, when he became a trolley boy on a weekly salary of £76. ‘It was less money than my previous job, but I loved it. It was different and diverse. I was doing trolleys, portering, bread, cakes, dairy and general maintenance.’ After a period in the produce department looking after the fruit and vegetables, he was made produce manager, then assistant store manager before reaching the top job in 1998. This involved intensive training and assessment through the company’s future store manager programme, learning how to analyse and prioritise sales, wastage, recruitment and many other issues. Perriss’ first stop as the store manager was at a store which was closed soon afterwards, though he was not to blame.
      </p>
      <p style="margin:0;"><strong>D:</strong> Despite the disappointing start, his career went from strength to strength and he was put in charge of launching new stores and heading up a ‘concept’ store, where the then new ideas of preparing and cooking pizzas in store, having a proper florist and fruit and vegetable ‘markets’ were trialled. All Morrisons’ managers from the whole country spent three days there to see the new concept. That was hard work,’ he says, ‘long days, seven days a week, for about a year.
      </p>
      <p style="margin:0;"><strong>E:</strong> Although he oversees a store with a large turnover, there is a strong practical aspect to Perriss’s job. As we walk around, he chats to all the staff while checking the layout of their counters and the quality of the produce. He examines the baking potato shelf and rejects three, one that has split virtually in half and two that are beginning to go green. He then pulls out a lemon that looks fine to me. When I ask why, he picks up a second lemon and says: ‘Close your eyes and just feel and tell me which you would keep.’ I do and realise that while one is firm and hard, the other is going a bit squashy.
      </p>
      <p style="margin:0;"><strong>F:</strong> Despite eagle-eyed Perriss pulling out fruit and vegetable that most of us would buy without a second thought, the wastage each week is tiny: produce worth £4,200 is marked down for a quick sale, and only £400-worth is scrapped. This, he explains, is down to Morrisons’ method of ordering, still done manually rather than by computer.

      <p style="margin:0;"><strong>G:</strong> Perriss is in charge of 1,000 man-hours a week across the store. To help him, he has a key team of four, who each have direct responsibility for different departments. He is keen to hear what staff think. He recently held a ‘talent’ day, inviting employees interested in moving to a new job within the store to come and talk to him about why they thought they should be promoted, and discuss how to go about it. ‘We had twenty-three people come through the door, people wanting to talk about progression,’ he says. ‘What do they need to do to become a supervisor? Twenty-three people will be better members of staff as a result of that talk.’

      <p style="margin:0;"><strong>H:</strong> His favourite department is fish, which has a four-meter-long run by Debbie and Angela, who are busy having a discussion about how to cook a particular fish with a customer. But it is one of just 20 or so departments around the store and Perriss admits the pressure of making sure he knows what’s happening on them all can be intense. ‘You have to do so much and there could be something wrong with every single one, every day,’ he says. ‘You’ve got to minimise those things and shrink them into perspective. You’ve got to love the job.’ This is what Perriss certainly does.

      <h4 style="margin:5px 0;">Marketing advice for new businesses</h4>
      <p style="margin:5px 0;">If you’re setting up your own business, here’s some advice on getting customers.</p>
      <p style="margin:5px 0;"><strong>Know where your customers look</strong><br>
         Your customers aren’t necessarily where you think they are. So if you’re advertising where they’re just not looking, it’s wasted money. That’s why it pays to do a bit of research. Every time someone contacts your company, ask them where they found out about you. And act on this information so you’re advertising in the right places.
      </p>
      <p style="margin:5px 0;"><strong>Always think like a customer</strong><br>
         What makes your customers tick? Find out, and you’re halfway to saying the right things in your advertising. So take the time to ask them. A simple phone or email survey of your own customers, politely asking why they use you, what they really like and what they don’t, is invaluable.
      </p>
      <p style="margin:5px 0;"><strong>Make sure customers know you’re there</strong><br>
         If a customer can't see you, they can't buy from you. There are loads of opportunities to promote your business — print, press, direct mail, telemarketing, email and the internet — and using a mix of these increases your chances of being seen (and remembered).
      </p>
      <p style="margin:5px 0;"><strong>Ignore your customers and they’ll go away</strong><br>
         It sounds obvious, but companies who talk to their customers have much better retention rates than those that don’t, so it’s worth staying in touch. Capture your customers’ email addresses upfront. Follow up a transaction to check they’re happy with the service and, if possible, send them updates that are helpful, informative and relevant.
      </p>
      <p style="margin:5px 0;"><strong>Know what works (and what doesn’t)</strong><br>
         Do what the professionals do, and measure all your advertising. That’ll tell you what you’re doing right - and where there’s room for improvement. You never know, it might just throw up some information that could change your business for the better.
      </p>
      <p style="margin:5px 0;"><strong>Remember word-of-mouth: the best advertising there is</strong><br>
         A recent survey found that consumers are 50% more likely to be influenced by word-of-mouth recommendations than by TV or radio ads. So your reputation is your greatest asset. If your current customers are impressed with your company, they’ll be more inclined to recommend you to others. On the flip side, if they experience bad service they probably won’t complain to you - but you can be sure they will to their friends.

      <p>Read the text below and answer Questions 21-27.</p>
      <h3 style="margin-top:10px;">Working Time Regulations for Mobile Workers</h3>
      <p style="margin:5px 0;">These rules apply to drivers and crew of heavy goods vehicles or public service vehicles. The rules limit the amount of time that can be worked. Those defined in the Regulations as being self-employed are currently not covered by the Regulations.</p>
      <p style="margin:5px 0;"><strong>What are the limits?</strong></p>
      <ul style="margin-left:20px; padding-left:0;">
        <li>An average of 48 hours' work per week.</li>
        <li>In any single week up to 60 hours can be worked so long as the 48-hour average is maintained.</li>
        <li>Night work is limited to 10 hours per night, unless there is a workforce agreement to work longer.</li>
        <li>Statutory annual leave and any sick leave and/or maternity/paternity leave counts as working time.</li>
      </ul>
      <p style="margin:5px 0;"><strong>What counts as work?</strong> In general, any activity performed in connection with the transport operation counts as work, for example, driving, loading/unloading and those checks that are the responsibility of drivers, such as checking lights, brakes, etc. There are a number of periods of time that do not count as work, for example, travelling between home and your normal place of work, lunch or other breaks and periods of availability.</p>
      <p style="margin:5px 0;">Periods of availability are periods of time during which the mobile worker is not required to remain at their workstation but is required to be available for work, the foreseeable duration of which is known about in advance, for example:</p>
      <ul style="margin-left:20px; padding-left:0;">
        <li>Delays at a distribution centre.</li>
        <li>Reporting for work then being informed that no duties are to be undertaken for a specified period.</li>
        <li>Accompanying a vehicle being transported, for example by train.</li>
      </ul>
      <p style="margin:5px 0;">A period of availability can be taken at the workstation. Providing the worker has a reasonable amount of freedom (e.g. they can read and relax) for a known duration, this could satisfy the requirements of a period of availability.</p>
      <p style="margin:5px 0;">Situations when a period of time should not be recorded as a period of availability:</p>
      <ul style="margin-left:20px; padding-left:0;">
        <li>Hold-ups due to congestion, because the driver would be stopping and starting the vehicle.</li>
        <li>Frequently moving up within a queue (e.g. waiting within a queue to load or unload) every other minute.</li>
      </ul>

        </li>
        <li>Maximum working hours: 60 hours a week, provided the

        <li>A period at the workstation when the driver has some

      <h3 style="margin-top:10px;">What is it like to run a large supermarket?</h3>
      <p style="font-weight: bold;">Jill Insley finds out</p>
      <p style="margin:5px 0;"><strong>A:</strong> You can’t beat really good service. I’ve been shopping in the Thamesmead branch of supermarket chain Morrisons, in south-east London, and I’ve experienced at first hand, the store’s latest maxim for improving the shopping experience &ndash; help, offer, thank. This involves identifying customers who might need help, greeting them, asking what they need, providing it, thanking them and leaving them in peace. If they don’t look like they want help, they’ll be left alone. But if they’re standing looking lost and perplexed, a member of staff will approach them. Staff are expected to be friendly to everyone. My checkout assistant has certainly said something to amuse the woman in front of me, she’s smiling as she leaves. Adrian Perriss, manager of the branch, has discussed the approach with each of his 387 staff. He says it’s about recognising that someone needs help, not being a nuisance to them. When he’s in another store, he’s irritated by someone saying, ‘Can I help you?’ when he’s only just walked in to have a quick look at the products.</p>
      <p style="margin:5px 0;"><strong>B:</strong> How anyone can be friendly and enthusiastic when they start work at dawn beats me. The store opens at 7 am, Monday to Saturday, meaning that some staff, including Perriss, have to be here at 6 am to make sure it’s clean, safe and stocked up for the morning rush. Sometimes he walks in at 6 am and thinks they’re never going to be ready on time, but they always are. There’s so much going on overnight &ndash; 20 people working on unloading three enormous trailers full of groceries.</p>
      <p style="margin:5px 0;"><strong>C:</strong> Perriss has worked in supermarkets since 1982, when he became a trolley boy on a weekly salary of £76. ‘It was less money than my previous job, but I loved it. It was different and diverse. I was doing trolleys, portering, bread, cakes, dairy and general maintenance.’ After a period in the produce department looking after the fruit and vegetables, he was made produce manager, then assistant store manager before reaching the top job in 1998. This involved intensive training and assessment through the company’s future store manager programme, learning how to analyse and prioritise sales, wastage, recruitment and many other issues. Perriss’ first stop as the store manager was at a store which was closed soon afterwards, though he was not to blame.
      </p>
      <p style="margin:5px 0;"><strong>D:</strong> Despite the disappointing start, his career went from strength to strength and he was put in charge of launching new stores and heading up a ‘concept’ store, where the then new ideas of preparing and cooking pizzas in store, having a proper florist and fruit and vegetable ‘markets’ were trialled. All Morrisons’ managers from the whole country spent three days there to see the new concept. That was hard work,’ he says, ‘long days, seven days a week, for about a year.
      </p>
      <p style="margin:5px 0;"><strong>E:</strong> Although he oversees a store with a large turnover, there is a strong practical aspect to Perriss’s job. As we walk around, he chats to all the staff while checking the layout of their counters and the quality of the produce. He examines the baking potato shelf and rejects three, one that has split virtually in half and two that are beginning to go green. He then pulls out a lemon that looks fine to me. When I ask why, he picks up a second lemon and says: ‘Close your eyes and just feel and tell me which you would keep.’ I do and realise that while one is firm and hard, the other is going a bit squashy.
      </p>
      <p style="margin:5px 0;"><strong>F:</strong> Despite eagle-eyed Perriss pulling out fruit and vegetable that most of us would buy without a second thought, the wastage each week is tiny: produce worth £4,200 is marked down for a quick sale, and only £400-worth is scrapped. This, he explains, is down to Morrisons’ method of ordering, still done manually rather than by computer. Department heads know exactly how much they’ve sold that day and how much they’re likely to sell the next, based on sales records and allowing for influences such as the weather.
      </p>
      <p style="margin:5px 0;"><strong>G:</strong> Perriss is in charge of 1,000 man-hours a week across the store. To help him, he has a key team of four, who each have direct responsibility for different departments. He is keen to hear what staff think. He recently held a ‘talent’ day, inviting employees interested in moving to a new job within the store to come and talk to him about why they thought they should be promoted, and discuss how to go about it. ‘We had twenty-three people come through the door, people wanting to talk about progression,’ he says. ‘What do they need to do to become a supervisor? Twenty-three people will be better members of staff as a result of that talk.’
      </p>
      <p style="margin:5px 0;"><strong>H:</strong> His favourite department is fish, which has a four-meter-long run by Debbie and Angela, who are busy having a discussion about how to cook a particular fish with a customer. But it is one of just 20 or so departments around the store and Perriss admits the pressure of making sure he knows what’s happening on them all can be intense. ‘You have to do so much and there could be something wrong with every single one, every day,’ he says. ‘You’ve got to minimise those things and shrink them into perspective.

      <h3 style="margin-top:10px;">Working Time Regulations for Mobile Workers</h3>
      <p style="margin:5px 0;">These rules apply to drivers and crew of heavy goods vehicles or public service vehicles. The rules limit the amount of time that can be worked. Those defined in the Regulations as being self-employed are currently not covered by the Regulations.</p>
      <p style="margin:5px 0;"><strong>What are the limits?</strong></p>
      <ul style="margin-left:20px; padding-left:0;">
        <li>An average of 48 hours' work per week.</li>
        <li>In any single week up to 60 hours can be worked so long as the 48-hour average is maintained.</li>
        <li>Night work is limited to 10 hours per night, unless there is a workforce agreement to work longer.</li>
        <li>Statutory annual leave and any sick leave and/or maternity/paternity leave counts as working time.</li>
      </ul>
      <p style="margin:5px 0;"><strong>What counts as work?</strong> In general, any activity performed in connection with the transport operation counts as work, for example, driving, loading/unloading and those checks that are the responsibility of drivers, such as checking lights, brakes, etc. There are a number of periods of time that do not count as work, for example, travelling between home and your normal place of work, lunch or other breaks and periods of availability.</p>
      <p style="margin:5px 0;">Periods of availability are periods of time during which the mobile worker is not required to remain at their workstation but is required to be available for work, the foreseeable duration of which is known about in advance, for example:</p>
      <ul style="margin-left:20px; padding-left:0;">
        <li>Delays at a distribution centre.</li>
        <li>Reporting for work then being informed that no duties are to be undertaken for a specified period.</li>
        <li>Accompanying a vehicle being transported, for example by train.</li>
      </ul>
      <p style="margin:5px 0;">A period of availability can be taken at the workstation. Providing the worker has a reasonable amount of freedom (e.g. they can read and relax) for a known duration, this could satisfy the requirements of a period of availability.</p>
      <p style="margin:5px 0;">Situations when a period of time should not be recorded as a period of availability:</p>
      <ul style="margin-left:20px; padding-left:0;">
        <li>Hold-ups due to congestion, because the driver would be stopping and starting the vehicle.</li>
        <li>Frequently moving up within a queue (e.g. waiting within a queue to load or unload) every other minute.</li>

      <h3 style="margin-top:10px;">What is it like to run a large supermarket?</h3>
      <p style="font-weight: bold;">Jill Insley finds out</p>
      <p style="margin:5px 0;"><strong>A:</strong> You can’t beat really good service. I’ve been shopping in the Thamesmead branch of supermarket chain Morrisons, in south-east London, and I’ve experienced at first hand, the store’s latest maxim for improving the shopping experience &ndash; help, offer, thank. This involves identifying customers who might need help, greeting them, asking what they need, providing it, thanking them and leaving them in peace. If they don’t look like they want help, they’ll be left alone. But if they’re standing looking lost and perplexed, a member of staff will approach them. Staff are expected to be friendly to everyone. My checkout assistant has certainly said something to amuse the woman in front of me, she’s smiling as she leaves. Adrian Perriss, manager of the branch, has discussed the approach with each of his 387 staff. He says it’s about recognising that someone needs help, not being a nuisance to them. When he’s in another store, he’s irritated by someone saying, ‘Can I help you?’ when he’s only just walked in to have a quick look at the products.</p>
      <p style="margin:5px 0;"><strong>B:</strong> How anyone can be friendly and enthusiastic when they start work at dawn beats me. The store opens at 7 am, Monday to Saturday, meaning that some staff, including Perriss, have to be here at 6 am to make sure it’s clean, safe and stocked up for the morning rush. Sometimes he walks in at 6 am and thinks they’re never going to be ready on time, but they always are. There’s so much going on overnight &ndash; 20 people working on unloading three enormous trailers full of groceries.</p>
      <p style="margin:5px 0;"><strong>C:</strong> Perriss has worked in supermarkets since 1982, when he became a trolley boy on a weekly salary of £76. ‘It was less money than my previous job, but I loved it. It was different and diverse. I was doing trolleys, portering, bread, cakes, dairy and general maintenance.’ After a period in the produce department looking after the fruit and vegetables, he was made produce manager, then assistant store manager before reaching the top job in 1998. This involved intensive training and assessment through the company’s future store manager programme, learning how to analyse and prioritise sales, wastage, recruitment and many other issues. Perriss’ first stop as the store manager was at a store which was closed soon afterwards, though he was not to blame.
      </p>
      <p style="margin:5px 0;"><strong>D:</strong> Despite the disappointing start, his career went from strength to strength and he was put in charge of launching new stores and heading up a ‘concept’ store, where the then new ideas of preparing and cooking pizzas in store, having a proper florist and fruit and vegetable ‘markets’ were trialled. All Morrisons’ managers from the whole country spent three days there to see the new concept. That was hard work,’ he says, ‘long days, seven days a week, for about a year.
      </p>
      <p style="margin:5px 0;"><strong>E:</strong> Although he oversees a store with a large turnover, there is a strong practical aspect to Perriss’s job. As we walk around, he chats to all the staff while checking the layout of their counters and the quality of the produce. He examines the baking potato shelf and rejects three, one that has split virtually in half and two that are beginning to go green. He then pulls out a lemon that looks fine to me. When I ask why, he picks up a second lemon and says: ‘Close your eyes and just feel and tell me which you would keep.’ I do and realise that while one is firm and hard, the other is going a bit squashy.
      </p>
      <p style="margin:5px 0;"><strong>F:</strong> Despite eagle-eyed Perriss pulling out fruit and vegetable that most of us would buy without a second thought, the wastage each week is tiny: produce worth £4,200 is marked down for a quick sale, and only £400-worth is scrapped. This, he explains, is down to Morrisons’ method of ordering, still done manually rather than by computer. Department heads know exactly how much they’ve sold that day and how much they’re likely to sell the next, based on sales records and allowing for influences such as the weather.
      </p>
      <p style="margin:5px 0;"><strong>G:</strong> Perriss is in charge of 1,000 man-hours a week across the store. To help him, he has a key team of four, who each have direct responsibility for different departments. He is keen to hear what staff think. He recently held a ‘talent’ day, inviting employees interested in moving to a new job within the store to come and talk to him about why they thought they should be promoted, and discuss how to go about it. ‘We had twenty-three people come through the door, people wanting to talk about progression,’ he says. ‘What do they need to do to become a supervisor? Twenty-three people will be better members of staff as a result of that talk.’
      </p>
      <p style="margin:5px 0;"><strong>H:</strong> His favourite department is fish, which has a four-meter-long run by Debbie and Angela, who are busy having a discussion about how to cook a particular fish with a customer. But it is one of just 20 or so departments around the store and Perriss admits the pressure of making sure he knows what’s happening on them all can be intense. ‘You have to do so much and there could be something wrong with every single one, every day,’ he says. ‘You’ve got to minimise those things and shrink them into perspective. You’ve got to love the job.’ This is what Perriss certainly does.

      <p>You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 15-27, which are based on Reading Passages below.</p>
      <h3 style="margin-top:10px;">Read the text below and answer Questions 15-20.</h3>
      <h4 style="margin:5px 0;">Marketing advice for new businesses</h4>
      <p style="margin:5px 0;">If you’re setting up your own business, here’s some advice on getting customers.</p>
      <p style="margin:5px 0;"><strong>Know where your customers look</strong><br>
         Your customers aren’t necessarily where you think they are. So if you’re advertising where they’re just not looking, it’s wasted money. That’s why it pays to do a bit of research. Every time someone contacts your company, ask them where they found out about you. And act on this information so you’re advertising in the right places.
      </p>
      <p style="margin:5px 0;"><strong>Always think like a customer</strong><br>
         What makes your customers tick? Find out, and you’re halfway to saying the right things in your advertising. So take the time to ask them. A simple phone or email survey of your own customers, politely asking why they use you, what they really like and what they don’t, is invaluable.
      </p>
      <p style="margin:5px 0;"><strong>Make sure customers know you’re there</strong><br>
         If a customer can't see you, they can't buy from you. There are loads of opportunities to promote your business — print, press, direct mail, telemarketing, email and the internet — and using a mix of these increases your chances of being seen (and remembered).
      </p>
      <p style="margin:5px 0;"><strong>Ignore your customers and they’ll go away</strong><br>
         It sounds obvious, but companies who talk to their customers have much better retention rates than those that don’t, so it’s worth staying in touch. Capture your customers’ email addresses upfront. Follow up a transaction to check they’re happy with the service and, if possible, send them updates that are helpful, informative and relevant.
      </p>
      <p style="margin:5px 0;"><strong>Know what works (and what doesn’t)</strong><br>
         Do what the professionals do, and measure all your advertising. That’ll tell you what you’re doing right - and where there’s room for improvement. You never know, it might just throw up some information that could change your business for the better.
      </p>
      <p style="margin:5px 0;"><strong>Remember word-of-mouth: the best advertising there is</strong><br>
         A recent survey found that consumers are 50% more likely to be influenced by word-of-mouth recommendations than by TV or radio ads. So your reputation is your greatest asset. If your current customers are impressed with your company, they’ll be more inclined to recommend you to others. On the flip side, if they experience bad service they probably won’t complain to you - but you can be sure they will to their friends.

        <h3 style="margin-top:20px;">A brief history of automata</h3>
        <p>
          An automaton is a machine, usually made to resemble a person or animal, that operates on its own, once it has been started. Although few are constructed nowadays, they have a history stretching back well over two thousand years. Several myths show that the ancient Greeks were interested in the creation of automata. In one, Hephaestus, the god of all mechanical arts, was reputed to have made two female statues of pure gold which assisted him and accompanied him wherever he went. As well as giving automata a place in mythology, the Greeks almost certainly created some. These were probably activated by levers and powered by human action, although there are descriptions of steam and water being used as sources of power. Automata were sometimes intended as toys, or as tools for demonstrating basic scientific principles.

          Other ancient cultures, too, seem to have developed automata. In Egypt, Ctesibius experimented with air pressure and pneumatic principles. One of his creations was a singing blackbird powered by water. A Chinese text of the third century BC describes a life-size, human-shaped figure that could walk rapidly, move its head up and down, sing and wink its eye.

        <p>
          Much later, Arab engineers of the ninth and thirteenth centuries wrote detailed treatises on how to build programmable musical fountains, mechanical servants, and elaborate clocks. A ninth-century ruler in Baghdad had a silver and gold tree with metal birds that sang. The art of creating automata developed considerably during the fifteenth century, linked with improvements in clock making: the mechanisms of automata and clocks had a great deal in common. Some truly remarkable automata were produced at this time. Muller was reputed to have made an artificial eagle which flew to greet the Emperor on his entry into Nuremberg, Germany, in 1470, then returned to perch on top of a city gate and, by stretching its wings and bowing, saluted the emperor on his arrival. Leonardo da Vinci made a lion in honour of the king of France, which advanced towards him, stopped, opened its chest with a claw and pointed to the French coat of arms.

          Automata were normally very expensive toys for the very rich. They were made for royal or aristocratic patrons, to be viewed only by themselves and selected guests – who were expected to be impressed by their wealth. Automata were also created for public show, however, and many appeared on clock towers, such as one in Bern, Switzerland, built in 1530.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the eighteenth century, some watchmakers made automata to contribute to the progress of medicine and the natural sciences, particularly to investigate the mechanical laws governing the structure and movement of living things. Many of their creations simulated almost perfectly the complex structure of human beings and animals. Maillardet made extensive use of gearing and cogs to produce automata of horses, worked by turning a handle. Vaucanson produced a duck made of gilded copper which ate, drank and quacked like a real duck. He also made a life-size female flute player. Air passes through the complex mechanism, causing the lips and fingers of the player to move naturally on the flute, opening and closing holes on it. This automaton had a repertoire of twelve tunes.
        </p>
        <p>
          In another well-known piece, Merlin’s silver swan made in 1773, the swan sits in a stream consisting of glass rods where small silver fish are swimming. When the clockwork is wound, a music box plays and the glass rods rotate, giving the impression of a flowing stream. The swan turns its head from side to side. It soon notices the fish and bends down to catch and eat one, then raises its head to the upright position. The mechanism still works.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the most skilled makers of automata was the Swiss watchmaker Jaquet-Droz. He produced three automata which, even today, are considered wonders of science and mechanical engineering. One of these, <strong>The Writer</strong>, simulates a boy sitting at a desk, dipping his pen into the ink and writing perfectly legibly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another stunning creation of the eighteenth century was the Mechanical Theatre in the grounds of Austria’s Hellbrunn Palace, home of the Archbishop of Salzburg. Designed by the miner Rosenegger, and completed in 1752, this depicts the nobility’s idea of a perfect society, with every class in its proper place. The figures inside a palace depict eighteenth-century court life, while industrious activity is carried on in and around this building. A total of 141 mobile and 52 immobile little figures demonstrate all manner of trades of the period: building workers bring materials to the foreman, who drinks; butchers slaughter an ox; a barber shaves a man. A dancing bear performs, guards march past the palace, a farmer pushes an old woman in a wheelbarrow over the road. The theatre shows great skill in clock making and water technology, consisting of hidden waterwheels, copper wiring and cogwheels.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the nineteenth century, mass production techniques meant that automata could be made cheaply and easily, and they became toys for children rather than an expensive adult amusement. Between 1860 and 1910, small family businesses in Paris made thousands of clockwork automata and mechanical singing birds and exported them around the world. However, the twentieth century saw traditional forms of automata fall out of favour.
