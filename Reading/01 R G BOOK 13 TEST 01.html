<h4><u>New York Late-Starters String Orchestra</u></h4>
<p>
  NYLSO, the New York Late-Starters String Orchestra, is something special. It
  was founded in early 2007, and grew out of a concept developed by The East
  London Late Starters Orchestra (ELLSO), an award-winning group in England.
  NYLSO is an amateur orchestra for adult players of violin, viola, cello, and
  double bass. If you played a string instrument when you were younger and would
  like to start again, or if you are learning as an adult and would like the
  chance to play in a group of similar people, then NYLSO is for you! Our goal
  is to create a fun, supportive, non-competitive environment for adults 18 to
  80+ who wish to participate in collective music¬making.
</p>

<p>
  Participants should have basic music reading skills and a willingness to
  commit to the group, but are not required to audition. It is recommended that
  you have studied your instrument for at least one year. If you have ever been
  paid to play your instrument, recently graduated with a degree in performance,
  or have been playing continuously since elementary school, you may decide we
  are not the appropriate group for you.
</p>

<h5>We Work:</h5>
<p>
  We know that New Yorkers are busy people. It is fine if you miss an entire
  rehearsal period when an emergency arises. Ultimately, though, too many
  absences disrupt the function of the group and make it difficult to perform
  the pieces. Sessions are in six-week rehearsal cycles, with two-hour
  rehearsals held once a week. We work with the goal of producing one to three
  very informal ‘friends-and-family’ concerts per year.
</p>

<p>
  Our professional tutor/facilitator serves as coach and conductor during
  rehearsals. Substitute conductors also join in to teach different sections,
  providing groups of players with valuable experience in working with different
  approaches and styles. Everyone is encouraged to play to their fullest
  potential, whatever that may be, but please recognize that while we do have a
  conductor, her role is not to provide one-on-one instruction during
  rehearsals. NYLSO is a self-supporting collective; we do not receive any other
  funding. The cost is $80 for each six-week cycle. Payments are applied to the
  costs of rehearsal space, conductor’s fees, and photocopying music.
</p>

<h5>You Will Need At Rehearsals:</h5>
<p>
  You will need an instrument, a portable music stand, and any other relevant
  accessories. You should bring a folder to keep your music together and a
  soft-lead pencil with an eraser for writing in changes. Sheet music is
  provided.

<h4><u>7 best running watches</u></h4>
<p>
  Kate Hilpern advises people on the best watches to use when they go running.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>A</strong> Soleus FIT 1.0<br />

  Soleus claims this has everything you need and nothing you don’t. Water-
  resistant to 30m and with a built-in rechargeable battery, it’s accurate at
  measuring speed, pace, distance and calories burnt.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>B</strong> Nike+ SportWatch GPS<br />
  You’ll be hard pushed to find a running watch that finds a GPS signal quicker
  than this. It will keep you updated on current location, distance covered,
  number of laps and calories burnt.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>C</strong> Garmin Forerunner<br />
  This watch, which is small enough to wear at the office, is touchscreen and is
  packed with impressive features, although the battery life is limited.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>D</strong> Timex Run Trainer 2.0<br />
  The hi-res screen makes this a great watch for athletes at any level. The
  easy-to-use, upgraded menu system makes monitoring pace, speed and distance
  child’s play. Alerts remind you when it’s time to hydrate or top up the
  nutrition.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>E</strong> Garmin Forerunner 10<br />
  This is a well-priced, entry-level watch that’s light as well as waterproof
  and available in a range of colours. Don’t expect added extras, but do expect
  good basic functionality.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>F</strong> Nike Fuelband<br />
  Described by the Huffington Post as ‘the sports watch you never knew you
  needed,’ this soft-touch and lightweight watch has been lovingly designed to
  appear more like a piece of futuristic jewellery than a running watch. But
  it’s hi-tech too and synchronises with your phone to show the results.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>G</strong> Suunto Ambit2 S HR<br />
  This is better suited to off-roaders rather than urban runners and although
  it’s quite big, it has a functional design and is compatible with the
  thousands of Suunto apps available.

</p>
<strong>Employees’ health and safety responsibilities</strong><br /><br />
<p>
  As an employee you have rights and you have responsibilities for your own
  wellbeing and that of your colleagues. This article explains what these
  responsibilities are, and how you can meet them.
</p>

<strong>Your rights</strong>
<p>
  Your rights as an employee to work in a safe and healthy environment are set
  down in law and generally can’t be changed or removed by your employer. The
  most important of these rights are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    As far as possible, to have any hazards to your health and safety properly
    controlled.
  </li>
  <li>
    To be given any personal protective and safety equipment without being
    charged for it.
  </li>
  <li>
    To stop work and leave your work area, without being disciplined, if you
    have reasonable concerns about your safety.
  </li>
  <li>To tell your employer about any health and safety concerns you have.</li>
  <li>
    Not to be disciplined if you contact the Health and Safety Executive, or
    your local authority, if your employer won’t listen to you.
  </li>
  <li>To have breaks during the time you are at work.</li>
  <li>To have time off from work during the working week.</li>
  <li>To have annual paid holiday.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Your responsibilities</strong>
<p>Your most important responsibilities as an employee are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To take reasonable care of your own health and safety.</li>
  <li>
    To remove jewellery and avoid loose clothing when operating machinery.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you have long hair, or wear a headscarf, make sure it’s tucked out of the
    way as it could get caught in machinery.
  </li>
  <li>
    To take reasonable care not to expose fellow employees and members of the
    public to risk by what you do or don’t do in the course of your work.
  </li>
  <li>
    To co-operate with your employer, making sure you complete the training that
    is provided and that you understand and follow the company’s health and
    safety policies.
  </li>
  <li>
    Not to interfere with or misuse anything that’s been provided for your
    health, safety or welfare.
  </li>
  <li>
    To report any injuries you suffer as a result of doing your job – your
    employer may then need to change the way you work.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  If you drive or operate machinery, you have a responsibility to tell your
  employer if you take medication that makes you feel sleepy. If you do, they
  should temporarily move you to another job if they have one for you to do.
</p>
<br /><br />

<h4>Our company notices</h4>

<h5>A Advance warning</h5>
<p>
  Refurbishment of offices in the Perkins Building will start on Monday 22 May,
  and is expected to be completed by the end of June. Staff based in that
  building will be individually notified of where they’ll work for that time. On
  the previous Friday, facilities staff will move everything that needs to go to
  your new office. Before then, please make a list of what should be moved, and
  another list of what can be stored.
</p>

<h5>B Information about financial systems</h5>
<p>
  The review of the company’s financial systems is now complete, and
  modifications will shortly be introduced. Jane Phillips from Finance will
  explain the changes and how they affect you, and answer any queries about
  them, between 12 and 1 pm on 15 March in Room 5.
</p>

<h5>C Purchasing Manager</h5>
<p>
  As you probably know, Sadia Ahmed is leaving the company on 31 March, after
  ten years as Purchasing Manager. Her replacement, Jeff Bridges, will join us
  on the previous Monday. Jeff will be in Room 70 between 12 and 2 pm on 3
  April: feel free to drop in and say hello to him during your lunch break.
</p>

<h5>D We’re doing well!</h5>
<p>
  We’ve received a large and urgent order from one of our major customers. As a
  result, we’ll need to run the production line for an additional three hours
  each evening throughout the week beginning 13 March. Any production workers
  willing to do this shift in addition to their normal work should speak to the
  Production Manager asap.
</p>

<h5>E Quality control</h5>
<p>
  Because of recent concerns about product quality, we’re setting up a team to
  consider ways of raising quality and making recommendations for changes. As
  staff from any department might have useful ideas, anyone is welcome to join
  the team – ring Rodrigo Perez on 1012. It will involve fortnightly meetings
  and some research, over a six-month period.
</p>

<h5>F New opportunity</h5>
<p>
  Dev Patel will cease to be part-time content editor of the company intranet at
  the end of April, as his new role in Marketing leaves him no time for it.
  We’re looking for two people to take over. If you’re interested, and can work
  an extra three or four hours a week (for extra pay, of course!), contact
  Maggie Campbell on 2146.
</p>

<h5>G And finally…</h5>
<p>
  We hope to re-start the company tennis championship, which hasn’t taken place
  for the last three years. If this is something for you, talk to Bill Sinclair
  on extension 2371. You don’t need to be a star player!

  <b><i>Read the text below and write the answer questions 28-40</i></b>
</p>
<h4><u>Vanilla – the most wonderful flavor in the world</u></h4>

<p>
  Vanilla is the most popular and widely used flavor in the world. And, yet, the
  vanilla orchid is only grown in a few countries. Below you’ll discover why
  these countries are ideal and how the vanilla from each region differs.
</p>

<h5>Mexico</h5>
<p>
  Vanilla (‘Vanilla planifolia Andrews) originated in Mexico and for centuries
  was the exclusive secret of the native Totonac Indians, who were later
  conquered by the Aztecs. The Aztecs in turn were conquered by the Spanish
  forces led by Cortez in 1520. He brought vanilla pods home to Spain, thus
  introducing the flavorful pods to the rest of the world.
</p>
<p>
  However, Mexico remained the sole grower of vanilla for another 300 years. The
  particular relationship between the vanilla orchid and an indigenous bee
  called the Melipone was crucial. It was responsible for pollinating the
  flowers, resulting in fruit production.
</p>
<p>
  Vanilla pods should be picked when the tip begins to turn yellow. The curing
  process gives the pods their characteristic brown color as well as their
  flavor and aroma. In Mexico, farmers cure the pods by wrapping them in
  blankets and straw mats and then placing them in ovens for 24 to 48 hours.
  After that, the pods are spread outdoors to absorb heat during the day and
  then placed in wooden boxes overnight. Once properly cured, they are stored to
  further develop the flavor. The entire curing process takes three to six
  months, making it a very labor-intensive process. Vanilla from Mexico has a
  flavor that combines creamy tones with a deep, spicy character, making it a
  delicious complement to chocolate, cinnamon and other warm spices. It also
  works wonderfully in tomato sauces.
</p>

<h5>Madagascar</h5>
<p>
  Around 1793, a vanilla plant was smuggled from Mexico to the Island of
  Reunion, east of Africa. For almost 50 years, the production of vanilla
  struggled. The vines grew successfully with beautiful blossoms but vanilla
  pods were infrequent. Without the Melipone bee, the flowers weren’t being
  fertilized beyond occasional pollination by other insects. It wasn’t until
  1836 that Charles Morren, a Belgian botanist, discovered the pollination link
  between bee and plant. And then in 1841, Edmond Albius of Reunion developed an
  efficient method for fertilizing the flower by hand. Now, growers could choose
  the best flowers to pollinate, resulting in a healthier and higher quality
  vanilla pod.
</p>
<p>
  Eventually, the plants arrived on the nearby island of Madagascar, where hand
  pollination proved its worth. Assisted by the climate and rich soil, hand
  pollination by the country’s skilled farmers has enabled Madagascar to become
  the world’s top vanilla producer in quantity and, many would argue, quality
</p>
<p>
  The curing process is similar to that in Mexico with one difference. The
  farmers initiate the process by immersing the green vanilla pods in hot water
  for some time. They then store them in sweat boxes before beginning the
  routine of spreading them outdoors during the day and packing them away at
  night. The different curing method used contributes to the overall flavor of
  the vanilla.
</p>
<p>
  The sweet, creamy and mellow flavor is the one most people identify with
  vanilla. This flavor and the pod’s ability to hold that flavor in both hot and
  cold applications make it an exceptional ‘all-purpose’ vanilla which is many
  people’s first choice for a wide range of sweet recipes – from cooking and
  baking to ice creams and buttercreams.
</p>
<h5>Tahiti</h5>
<p>
  Like the other countries, Tahiti’s tropical climate makes it ideal for growing
  vanilla. However, Tahiti differs in the species of vanilla that is most
  common: Vanilla tahitensis Moore. This is the hybrid of two vanilla species
  introduced in the 1800s. These two species were skilfully crossed in the next
  few decades, to create the plump Tahitian vanilla pods we know today.
</p>
<p>
  The curing process also differs from other countries’. Mature pods are first
  stacked in a cool place until they are completely brown (five to ten days) and
  then rinsed briefly in clear water, a unique characteristic of the method used
  in Tahiti. For the next month, growers expose the pods to the gentle morning
  sunlight. In the afternoon, they bind the pods in cloths and store them in
  crates until the next morning, to promote transpiration. Little by little, the
  vanilla pods lose weight and shrink. Throughout this phase, the workers
  carefully smooth and even out the pods with their fingers. Then after a month,
  the final step is to leave the pods in a shaded and well-ventilated spot for
  40 days to lower their moisture content.
</p>
<p>
  This species of orchid combined with Tahiti’s advantageous climate and soil
  results in a vanilla that has fruity and sweet tones. Tahitian vanilla is
  especially vulnerable to heat and is therefore best used in refrigerated and
  frozen desserts, fruit pies and smoothies.
</p>
<h5>Indonesia</h5>
<p>
  Indonesia is the second largest producer of vanilla. However, Indonesian
  production methods focus on quantity over quality. Unlike other regions, where
  vanilla beans are picked only when ripe, Indonesian growers harvest all the
  beans at one time, a labor-saving adjustment.
</p>
<p>
  The curing process also features production shortcuts such as the use of
  propane heaters to speed up drying. The use of such heat, which chemically
  alters the beans, essentially ‘bums off flavor components while adding a smoky
  tone, resulting in a less complex taste and a sharper flavor. Indonesian
  vanilla works well when blended with vanillas from other regions and, because
  it’s more economical, it makes the end product more affordable.

<h5>How vanilla pods are cured in Tahiti</h5>

<p>
  Tahitian farmers start by leaving the pods to turn
  <strong>35</strong><input name="q35" type="text" style="width: 100px" /> all
  over. They then wash them quickly before the main stage of the curing process
  begins. They place the pods in the <strong>36</strong
  ><input name="q36" type="text" style="width: 100px" /> during the early part
  of the day. Cloths are then wrapped round them and they are left in boxes
  overnight. This procedure encourages <strong>37</strong
  ><input name="q37" type="text" style="width: 100px" />. Gradually, the
  <strong>38</strong><input name="q38" type="text" style="width: 100px" /> of
  the individual pods starts to decrease. While this is happening, the farmers
  continue to work on the pods. They use their <strong>39</strong
  ><input name="q39" type="text" style="width: 100px" /> to flatten them out.
  For the last stage in the curing process, the pods are kept in a cool place
  which is open to the air, so that the amount of <strong>40</strong
  ><input name="q40" type="text" style="width: 100px" /> within them is reduced.
